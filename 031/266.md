# Lack of Validation for Registered Base Implementation in `BoostRegistry::deployClone` Function

## Summary
The `deployClone` function is designed to deploy a new instance of a registered base implementation, but it currently lacks validation to confirm that the provided base address (base_) is registered, allowing any address to be cloned.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostRegistry.sol#L102
The function's documentation indicates that it should only deploy clones of registered base implementations. However, the function does not perform any checks to validate whether base_ is a registered implementation. It directly proceeds to clone the provided base_ address without verification. This could result in unauthorized addresses being cloned and deployed

## Impact
Unauthorized users can deploy clones from any address without proper validation.

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
function deployClone(RegistryType type_, address base_, string calldata name_, bytes calldata data_)
    external
    nonReentrant
    returns (ACloneable instance)
{    
    // No check to verify if base_ is registered

    instance =
        ACloneable(base_.cloneAndInitialize(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(type_, base_, name_, msg.sender)), data_));
   //  The rest of code
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a validation check to ensure that the base_ address is registered before proceeding with the clone operation
