# Inconsistent Accounting in Token Transfers During Clawback

## Summary
The `clawback()` function allows reclaiming tokens from the budget contract, but improper accounting occurs in `_transferFungible()`. The function increments the `_distributedFungible` variable even when tokens are reclaimed, leading to discrepancies in the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_distributedFungible` and `_distributedERC1155` storage variables are used to store the number of tokens transferred to the incentives contract.

We have one function called `clawback()` function which is used to reclaim the tokens from the budget contract. `clawback()` function uses `_transferFungible()` and `_transferERC1155()` for transferring tokens from budget to the owner address. 

In the `_transferFungible()` it is adding _distributedFungible value by the amount which has to transfer. But when the tokens are transferred to the admin using clawback it still increments the value of the variable by the amount transferred.

The `_distributedFungible` variable tracks tokens transferred to incentives, but the value is incorrectly incremented even when tokens are clawed back to the admin. This results in misleading accounting data and could impact the accuracy of protocol balances.

## Impact
This could lead to significant discrepancies in the protocol's accounting, reflecting incorrect token distributions and affecting the correct allocation of tokens for future use.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Fix the `_transferFungible()` and `_transferERC1155()` function to avoid updating `_distributedFungible` and `_distributedERC1155()` when tokens are clawed back, ensuring that the variables only tracks distributions and not reclaim actions.
