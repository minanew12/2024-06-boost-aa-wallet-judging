# Incorrect accounting in clawback function

## Summary
The clawback function in the ManagedBudget contract incorrectly increments the distributed asset counters (_distributedFungible and _distributedERC1155) when reclaiming funds. This leads to inaccurate accounting of distributed assets and could potentially lock funds in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `clawback` function is meant to reclaim assets back to the owner but while doing this the function utilizes the `_transferFungible` and `_transferERC1155` functions;
```solidity
function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external virtual override onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) returns (bool) {
        Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
        if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH || request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));
            _transferFungible( // @audit
                request.asset, request.target, payload.amount == 0 ? available(request.asset) : payload.amount
            );
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
            ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));
            _transferERC1155( // @audit
                request.asset,
                request.target,
                payload.tokenId,
                payload.amount == 0 ? IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) : payload.amount,
                payload.data
            );
// ...
```
The issue with the `_transferFungible` and  `_transferERC1155` is that they always increments the `_distributedFungible[asset_]` and `_distributedERC1155[asset_][tokenId_]` respectively by `amount`
```solidity
function _transferFungible(address asset_, address to_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual nonReentrant {
    // ... 
    _distributedFungible[asset_] += amount_;  // <@
    // ... 
```
```solidity
function _transferERC1155(address asset_, address to_, uint256 tokenId_, uint256 amount_, bytes memory data_) internal virtual nonReentrant {
    // ...
    _distributedERC1155[asset_][tokenId_] += amount_;   // <@
    // ...
```
This is wrong because when admin reclaims (`clawback`) the amount is not being distributed to any one but rather just being taken away from the budget.
## Impact
In case the admin calls `clawback`, Incorrect information is returned by functions below which can not be changed in any way.
```solidity
function distributed(address asset_) external view virtual override returns (uint256) {
    return _distributedFungible[asset_]; // @audit
}
```
```solidity
function distributed(address asset_, uint256 tokenId_) external view virtual override returns (uint256) {
    return _distributedERC1155[asset_][tokenId_]; // @audit
}
```
This leads to misrepresentation of protocol information to external users or other systems off chain.

## Tool used
Manual Review and Intellij Idea

## Recommendation
You can do any of the following;
- Create separate internal functions for clawback transfers that do not increment the distributed counters.
- If you plan to keep using `_transferFungible` and `_transferERC1155` in both `clawback` and `disburse` then remove the `_distributedFungible[asset_] += amount_;` and `_distributedERC1155[asset_][tokenId_] += amount_;` from the transfer functions but rather add the increment logics to the `disburse()` after  the transfers.
