# Incorrect implementation of  `ManagedBudget::clawback()`

### Summary

`ManagedBudget` incorrectly implements [`clawback`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L99) which leads to the violation of some invariants.

### Root Cause

incorrect implementation

### Internal pre-conditions

Owner needs to call clawback with data

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-con

### Attack Path

Admin needs to call clawback() with valid data

### Impact

incorrect implementation which leads to the inflation of `_distributedFungible` and `_distributedERC1155`

### PoC

please hear me out.

`clawback` and `disburse` are not supposed to work the same but in this protocol it does 

from my search
`clawback` 
         - google - an act of retrieving money already paid out.
         - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clawback) - refers to any money or benefits that have been given out, but are required to be returned (clawed back) due to special circumstances or events.
         - [stellar](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/transactions-specialized/clawbacks) - allow an asset issuer to burn a specific amount of asset from a  claimable balance, effectively destroying it and removing it from a recipientâ€™s balance

`disburse`
         - google - pay out (money from a fund)

so from these definitions we can say clawback is he process of taking back or recovering funds that have already been paid out whilst disbursement is the act of paying out or distributing funds.

**Relating the protocol to this clawback is the rollback of assets allocated to budget**

with the understanding from these definitions lets look at the functions

```solidity
function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external virtual override onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) returns (bool) {
        Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
        if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH || request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));
            _transferFungible(...);
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
            ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));
            _transferERC1155(...);
        } 
...

    }

```

from the above function we can see clawback calls _transferFungible and _transferERC1155 after checks to execute transfer

but from the code below

```solidity
 function _transferFungible(address asset_, address to_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual nonReentrant {
...

        _distributedFungible[asset_] += amount_;

        // Transfer the asset to the recipient
...

        emit Distributed(asset_, to_, amount_);
    }

    function _transferERC1155(address asset_, address to_, uint256 tokenId_, uint256 amount_, bytes memory data_)
        internal
        virtual
        nonReentrant
    {
        // Increment the total amount of the asset distributed from the budget
...

        _distributedERC1155[asset_][tokenId_] += amount_;

        // Transfer the asset to the recipient
...

        emit Distributed(asset_, to_, amount_);
    }
```

from these two functions we can see that, before the transfer of tokens or erc1155 the `_distributedFungible` and `_distributedERC1155` are increased respectively meaning this clawback has been counted as effective disbursement but it is a rollback of asset allocated to the budget not a disbursement to a receiver

Note: The [disburse](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L127-L158) function uses the same _transferFungible and _transferERC1155 in disbursement 

to solidify this point lets look at the test files
```solidity
    function testClawback() public {
        // Approve the budget to transfer tokens
        mockERC20.approve(address(managedBudget), 100 ether);

        // Allocate 100 tokens to the budget
@1-->        bytes memory data = _makeFungibleTransfer(ABudget.AssetType.ERC20, address(mockERC20), address(this), 100 ether);
        managedBudget.allocate(data);
        assertEq(managedBudget.available(address(mockERC20)), 100 ether);

        // Reclaim 99 tokens from the budget
@2-->        data = _makeFungibleTransfer(ABudget.AssetType.ERC20, address(mockERC20), address(this), 99 ether);
        assertTrue(managedBudget.clawback(data));

        // Ensure the budget has 1 token left
        assertEq(managedBudget.available(address(mockERC20)), 1 ether);
    }
```

we can see that from the two @ tags the same address has been used in the data payload that shows the intended design is meant to only reclaim i.e an effective roll back of allocation as compared to the [disbure test](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/test/budgets/ManagedBudget.t.sol#L475-L485) which makes use of different addresses which confirms the invariant of disburment i.e paying out.

### Mitigation

1. Increase `_distributedFungible` only when disbursing or in disburse function.
2. implements checks to make sure address that deposited in budget is the same address reclaiming or in clawback data.
3. Implement a mapping to keep track of clawbacks instead of adding to distributed assets
