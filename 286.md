# Any new Boost can use an existing ManagedBudget contract to fund its Incentives

## Summary
Any new Boost can use an existing ManagedBudget contract to fund its Incentives

## Vulnerability Detail
When BoostCore.createBoost() is used, a ABudget contract is needed from which Incentive contracts will be funded. This fundation happens because BoostCore contract calls ```assert(budget_.disburse(preflight))```, which will send required tokens to each Incentives contract.

```disburse()``` function has an access control for to prevent from being drained by an unauthorized user. However, as it is always called by the BoostCore contract there is no middle point: a Budget contract will be available to fund any required Incentive (if BoostCore contract is owner, ADMIN_ROLE or MANAGER_ROLE in ManagedBudget contract) or no Incentive at all if BoostCore has none of this roles.

## Impact
No controlled access to allow or avoid a given Budget contract to be used to fund Incentive contracts. All allowed Budget contracts will be quickly drained by createBoost() function, even if this function is limited to authorized users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a (address => bool) mapping variable in the ManagedBudget which allows/prevents the use of that contract to each Boost creator, ```disburse()``` function should have an additional parameter with the msg.sender in the BoostCore context.

In ManagedBudget.sol:
```solidity
contract ManagedBudget is AManagedBudget, ReentrancyGuard {
+ mapping (address => bool) allowed;
.
.
.
- function disburse(bytes calldata data_)
+ function disburse(bytes calldata data_, address boostCreator)
        public
        virtual
.
.
.
+ if (!allowed[boostCreator]) revert();
```

In BoostCore.sol:
```solidity
function _makeIncentives(
.
.
.
- assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
+ assert(budget_.disburse(preflight,msg.sender));
```
