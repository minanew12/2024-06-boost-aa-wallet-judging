# Registry Pollution through Near-Duplicate Entries


## Summary
The `BoostRegistry::register` function in the contract checks for duplicate registrations based on the exact name and identifier, but it does not fully protect against near-duplicate registrations where small changes in names or parameters are made. This opens the registry to potential abuse, as malicious actors could create slightly altered names to pollute the registry with confusing or redundant entries. While the contract prevents exact duplicates, this loophole could lead to an inconsistent and bloated registry.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract relies on exact name matching for duplicate checks, which means that small alterations to the name (e.g., changing capitalization, adding spaces, or making minor character changes) would bypass the duplicate registration check. This could result in a cluttered registry where entries are nearly identical but treated as distinct, causing confusion for users and leading to potential registry bloat. Although this does not represent an immediate security breach, it could lead to operational inefficiencies and degrade the user experience.

## Impact
The primary impact is registry inconsistency and potential operational issues arising from registry bloat. Users could face confusion when trying to interact with near-duplicate entries, and the registry could become cluttered with redundant or malicious entries. This increases maintenance overhead and can potentially reduce the overall reliability of the system.

## Recommendation
To prevent registry pollution, it is recommended to implement stricter checks for near-duplicate entries. Consider normalizing the input names by applying transformations such as trimming whitespace, converting to lowercase, or even using techniques like Levenshtein distance or fuzzy matching to detect and prevent near-duplicate registrations. This will help ensure the registry remains consistent and free from redundant entries that could degrade user experience.
