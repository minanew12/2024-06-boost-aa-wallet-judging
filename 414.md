# Allow List Bypass Due to Missing Context

## Details

The Boost protocol uses the AAllowList contract and its implementations like SimpleAllowList and SimpleDenyList to control which users are eligible to participate in boosts. The isAllowed function is the primary method for determining if a user is authorized based on the implemented allow list logic.

A potential security vulnerability exists in how the isAllowed function is currently implemented in the SimpleAllowList and SimpleDenyList contracts. The issue stems from the lack of contextual information being passed to the isAllowed function.

## Code Snippets
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/allowlists/SimpleAllowList.sol#L38

```solidity
// SimpleAllowList.sol
/// ...
/// @notice Check if a user is authorized
/// @param user_ The address of the user
/// @param - The data payload for the authorization check, not used in this implementation
/// @return True if the user is authorized
function isAllowed(address user_, bytes calldata /* data_ - unused */) external view override returns (bool) {
    return _allowed[user_];
}
```

The function, as it stands, only checks a user's address against the _allowed mapping. This approach assumes a global allow list where being on the list grants permission to participate in any boost.

The same issue exists in SimpleDenyList.sol, where the check is reversed:

```solidity
// SimpleDenyList.sol
/// ...
function isAllowed(address user_, bytes calldata /* data_ - unused */) external view override returns (bool) {
    return !_denied[user_];
}
```

## Impact

The lack of contextual data in the isAllowed function could allow unauthorized users to participate in boosts. A malicious Boost creator could potentially:

Create a Boost with a permissive Allow List: The attacker could deploy a SimpleAllowList with their address included.

Reuse the Allow List: The attacker could then create another Boost, unrelated to the first, and use the same SimpleAllowList contract. Because the isAllowed function does not consider the Boost ID or any other contextual data, the attacker would be deemed authorized in the second Boost despite having no legitimate connection to it.

## Scenario

- An attacker deploys a SimpleAllowList contract, including their own address in the allowed list during initialization.
- The attacker creates two different Boosts. The first Boost might have a legitimate purpose, while the second one is intended to be exploitative.
- Both Boosts are configured to use the same SimpleAllowList contract deployed earlier.
- When the attacker participates in the second (malicious) boost, the isAllowed function approves them because their address is on the list, even though the list has no specific association with that particular Boost.

## Fix

To address this vulnerability, the isAllowed function should be modified to accept and utilize contextual data:

```solidity
// AAllowList.sol (and implementations)
function isAllowed(address user_, uint256 boostId, bytes calldata data_) external view virtual returns (bool);
```

boostId: The ID of the Boost for which authorization is being checked. This ensures the allow list check is specific to the intended Boost.

data_: This generic bytes field allows for additional context, such as:

- A specific role or permission level required for the Boost.

- A signature from an authorized entity granting access to the Boost.

Implementation in SimpleAllowList:

```solidity
// SimpleAllowList.sol (example implementation)
mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) internal _allowed; // boostId => user => allowed

// ...

function isAllowed(address user_, uint256 boostId, bytes calldata /* data_ */) external view override returns (bool) {
    return _allowed[boostId][user_];
}
```
