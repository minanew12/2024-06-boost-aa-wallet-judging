# `PUSH0` opcode Is Not Supported on Linea yet

## Summary
`PUSH0` opcode is not supported on Linea yet.
## Vulnerability Detail
The current codebase is compiled with Solidity `version 0.8.24`, which includes the PUSH0 opcode in the compiled bytecode. According to [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-on-what-chains-are-the-smart-contracts-going-to-be-deployed), the contract will developed on EVM-compatible networks and as we all know, Linea  is EVM-compatible.

This presents an issue because Linea does not yet support the`PUSH0` opcode, which can lead to unexpected behavior or outright failures when deploying and running the smart contracts.[see here](https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/ethereum-differences#evm-opcodes)
## Impact
Deploying the protocol on Linea with the current Solidity `version (0.8.24)` may result in unexpected behavior or failure due to the unsupported `PUSH0` opcode.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
for Linea you may consider to use version 0.8.19 to compile .
