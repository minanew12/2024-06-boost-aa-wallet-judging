# Linea doesn't support push0 opcode

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The current codebase is compiled with Solidity version 0.8.24, which includes the PUSH0 opcode. According to the [README :: the protocol will be deployed on the any EVM compatible network except zkSYNC ].

This presents an issue because Linea does not yet support the PUSH0 opcode, which can lead to unexpected behavior or outright failures when deploying and running the smart contracts.[see here](https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/ethereum-differences#evm-opcodes)

## Impact
Deploying the protocol on Linea with the current Solidity version (0.8.24) may result in unexpected behavior or failure due to the unsupported PUSH0 opcode.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
for Linea use version 0.8.19 to compile .
