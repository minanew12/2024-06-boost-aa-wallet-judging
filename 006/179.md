# PUSH0 opcode Is not yet supported on all EVM-compatible networks

### Summary

* The current codebase is compiled with Solidity version 0.8.24, which includes the PUSH0 opcode in the compiled bytecode. According to the README, the chains in scope are all EVM-compatible networks (excluding zkSync Era).
* The man issue is that certain EVM compatible chains do not yet support the PUSH0 opcode, such us Fantom and Linea, which can lead to unexpected behavior or failure when deploying and running the smart contracts.

### Root Cause

* Solidity version 0.8.24 as shown in following code snippet: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L2C1-L2C8
* You may check which chains support PUSH0 in the following link: https://push0.info/
* Linea does not support PUSH0 as seen here: https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/ethereum-differences#evm-opcodes

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Deploying the protocol on EVMs, such us Fantom or Linea, with the current Solidity version (0.8.24) may result in unexpected behavior or failure due to the unsupported PUSH0 opcode.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

for Linea and Fantom you may consider to use version 0.8.19 to compile or not to deploy in said chains or any that does not support the PUSH0 opcode.
