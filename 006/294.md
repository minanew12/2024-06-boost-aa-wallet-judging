# Protocol cannot be deployed on few chains.

## Summary
The protocol faces deployment issues on certain chains due to an incompatible Solidity version.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocolâ€™s README mentions that it supports **ALL** EVM-compatible chains, excluding those that do not support Create2. However, the contracts are written using Solidity version 0.8.24, which is not supported on several chains, including Linea, BSC etc. [Linea](https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/ethereum-differences)  and similar chains are incompatible with this Solidity version due to its use of the unsupported PUSH0 opcode.

## Impact

Deploying the protocol on Linea with the current Solidity version (0.8.24) may result in unexpected behavior or failure due to the unsupported PUSH0 opcode.

## Recommendation

For Linea you may consider to use version 0.8.19 to compile.
