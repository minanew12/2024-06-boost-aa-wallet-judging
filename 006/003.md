# PUSH0 opcode is not supported on Linea yet

### Summary

The current codebase is compiled with Solidity version ^0.8.24, which includes the PUSH0 opcode in the compiled bytecode. 

According to the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/README.md), the protocol can be deployed on any EVM-compatible networks, and so the Linea network.

This vulnerability is the same as this one: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-pooltogether-judging/issues/79

It is much more revelant here since the solady [LibClone](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L26) library uses push0 opcode.

### Root Cause

This presents an issue because Linea does not yet support the PUSH0 opcode, which can lead to unexpected behavior or outright failures when deploying and running the smart contracts. [See here](https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/ethereum-differences#evm-opcodes)

### Impact

Deploying the protocol on Linea with the current Solidity version may result in unexpected behavior or failure due to the unsupported PUSH0 opcode.

### PoC
