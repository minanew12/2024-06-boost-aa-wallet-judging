# Batch Processing for Deployed Clones

## Summary
The getClones function retrieves an array of identifiers for deployed clones associated with a specific deployer. However, if the number of clones is large, this can result in high gas costs, potentially leading to denial of service. The implementation of a limit on the number of clones returned can mitigate excessive gas usage.
## Vulnerability Detail
Function: getClones(address deployer_)
Issue: The function currently returns all identifiers of deployed clones for a given deployer without any restriction on the number of clones. This can lead to significant gas costs during execution, especially if the array of identifiers is large.
Gas Cost: Ethereum transactions have a gas limit, and if the gas required to process this function exceeds the limit, the transaction will fail. This creates a denial-of-service vulnerability for users attempting to retrieve clone identifiers.
## Impact
If an attacker or malicious user can deploy a large number of clones, they could exploit this function to generate excessive gas costs. This could lead to:

Denial of Service: Legitimate users may be unable to access the function due to high gas requirements.
Increased Costs: Users may incur unexpectedly high transaction fees when interacting with the contract.
## Code Snippet

```solidity
function getClones(address deployer_) external view returns (bytes32[] memory) {
    return _deployedClones[deployer_];
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
function getClones(address deployer_) external view returns (bytes32[] memory) {
    require(_deployedClones[deployer_].length < 100, "Too many clones");
    return _deployedClones[deployer_];
}
```
Limit Returned Clones: Implement a maximum limit on the number of clones that can be returned by the getClones function. The current limit is set at 100, which should be reviewed based on expected use cases.
