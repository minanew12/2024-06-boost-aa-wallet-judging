# Mismanagement of ERC20 Funds Across Multiple Incentives

### Summary

In the `ERC20Incentive` contract, the check for ensuring sufficient funds (`available < maxTotalReward`) uses the total balance of the ERC20 token held by the contract. Since multiple incentives might use the same ERC20 token and are all held by the same contract, this can cause one incentive to steal tokens allocated for another incentive. An attacker can exploit this by creating an incentive with inflated `init_.reward and init_.limit` to drain tokens from other incentives using the same ERC20.

### Root Cause

The check for sufficient funds (`available < maxTotalReward`) considers the total balance of the ERC20 token in the contract rather than the specific allocation for each incentive. Since all incentives share the same contract and use proxy patterns for isolation, one incentive can maliciously claim more tokens than allocated, causing issues for others.

```solidity
        uint256 maxTotalReward = init_.strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE ? init_.reward * init_.limit : init_.reward;
 @>>    uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
  @>>   if (available < maxTotalReward) {
            revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, maxTotalReward);
        }

```


### Internal pre-conditions

A valid incentive is made with a erc20

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. An attacker creates a new incentive using the same ERC20 token as another incentive.
2. The attacker inflates the init_.reward and init_.limit to a value greater than what was allocated in the ManagedBudget.
3. The initialize function checks the total balance of the ERC20 token (available), which includes tokens meant for other incentives.
4. As long as the total balance meets the requirement, the check passes, allowing the attacker to claim more tokens than allocated.
This misallocation causes other incentives to be underfunded, as tokens are drained by the attacker's incentive.

### Impact

Tokens meant for specific incentives can be drained by malicious incentives.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, each incentive should maintain its own separate record of available funds and ensure that checks are performed against these specific allocations rather than the total contract balance.
