# Immutable `VALIDATOR` state is never set in the constructor

## Summary
Immutable variable should be set in the constructor. Or else their state will be 0 forever.
And the state being read anywhere will read it as zero address leading to revert issues, Hence DOS.

```solidity
actions/AAction.sol

19:     /// @notice The validator for the action (which may be the action itself where appropriate)
20:     AValidator public immutable VALIDATOR;

EventAction.sol
26:     constructor() {
28:         _disableInitializers();
29:     }

```


## Impact
immutable `VALIDATOR` state is never set in the constructor. So wherever it is read will use zero address as validator leading to  DOS/wrong calls revert.
