# CGDA incentives can be claimed multiple times

### Summary

CGDA incentives can be claimed multiple times

### Root Cause

CGDA incentives can be claimed multiple times. This is because the `claimed` mapping is not written to:

Here we can observe in the CGDA incentive claim function it does not save to the `claimed` mapping

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L83-L100
```solidity 
    /// @inheritdoc AIncentive
    /// @notice Claim the incentive
    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
        claims++;

        // Calculate the current reward and update the state
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        cgdaParams.currentReward =
            reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;

        // Transfer the reward to the recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
        return true;
    }
```

Then during `_isClaimable` assuming the `reward > 0` and `asset.balanceOf(address(this)) >= reward`, it will always return true, because `claimed[recipient_]` is always `false`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L133-L136
```solidity
    function _isClaimable(address recipient_) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        return reward > 0 && asset.balanceOf(address(this)) >= reward && !claimed[recipient_];
    }
```

Therefore it can be claimed multiple times using multiple validator signatures. In the protocol, there is a scenario where multiple validator signatures are needed. This will be elaborated in the PoC section.

### Internal pre-conditions

Claimant must be able to get multiple validator signatures.

This can occur in boosts that contains multiple incentives where multiple `claim` functions require an extra `incentiveData` that needs to be signed, such as `ERC20VariableIncentive.claim` and `ERC1155VariableIncentive.claim`, so the claimant must get multiple validator signatures as they need to consist of the correct `incentiveData` in the hash
```solidity
    function validate(uint256 boostId, uint256 incentiveId, address claimant, bytes calldata claimData)
        external
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        if (msg.sender != _validatorCaller) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        (BoostClaimData memory claim) = abi.decode(claimData, (BoostClaimData));
        (SignerValidatorInputParams memory validatorData) =
            abi.decode(claim.validatorData, (SignerValidatorInputParams));

        bytes32 hash = hashSignerData(boostId, validatorData.incentiveQuantity, claimant, claim.incentiveData);
        
        if (uint256(validatorData.incentiveQuantity) <= incentiveId) {
            revert BoostError.InvalidIncentive(validatorData.incentiveQuantity, incentiveId);
        }

        if (!signers[validatorData.signer]) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        // Mark the incentive as claimed to prevent replays
        // checks internally if the incentive has already been claimed
        _used.setOrThrow(hash, incentiveId);

        // Return the result of the signature check
        // no need for a sig prefix since it's encoded by the EIP712 lib
        return validatorData.signer.isValidSignatureNow(hash, validatorData.signature);
```
The replay protection here will not work due to the different hashes.

### Impact

Multiple claiming of CGDA rewards

### PoC

Here is how a user can get multiple validator signatures. First we must understand that one validator signature is only required to access all incentives in the boost. However, certain `claim` functions require an extra `incentiveData` that also needs to be signed. Consider the scenario where a boost is setup that consists of 2 ERC20VariableIncentive for 2 different ERC20 tokens and 1 CGDAIncentive. Two validator signatures will be required to supply the 2 `ERC20VariableIncentive` functions. 

However, since the `incentiveData` is ignored for the `CGDAIncentive` and it does not keep track of the `claimed` mapping. These two signatures can be replayed to double claim from the `CGDAIncentive` resulting in loss of funds
