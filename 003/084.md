# HIGH-01 - CGDAIncentives::claim() can be drained due to lack of claim validation.

### Summary

  A user that can claim his incentives in `CGDAIncentives` contract, could drain the 
  funds on the contract by calling `claim()`, an unlimited amount of times as the function
  doesn't flag users that already claimed their incentive. 


### Root Cause

In CDGAIncentives::claim [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L87) there's a missing flag to account for users that already claim their incentive. You can see that this is a prerequisite [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L135) for a incentive to be claimable.

### Mitigation

```solidity
  /// @inheritdoc AIncentive
  /// @notice Claim the incentive
  function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
    claims++;
    // @audit claims should be flaged.
    claimed[claimTarget] = true;

    // Calculate the current reward and update the state
    uint256 reward = currentReward();
    cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    cgdaParams.currentReward =
      reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;

    // Transfer the reward to the recipient
    asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

    emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
    return true;
  }
