# In `CGDAIncentive` a claimant Target can receive the reward Incentive more than once which is not intented by the protocol.

## Summary
The logic of the `CGDAIncentive.sol` must enforces that a claimant target should receive a reward incentive only once but during a claim this is not enforced living that claimant target with the ability to claim more than once.

## Vulnerability Detail
The check in `CGDAIncentive:_isClaimable` shows that a recipient is only supposed to receive the reward incentive of this contract only once. After claiming, this should be marked in the `claimed[recipient_]` mapping so that he does not claim the reward again.

```Solidity
    function _isClaimable(address recipient_) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        return
            reward > 0 &&
            asset.balanceOf(address(this)) >= reward &&
 @@@>>>>    !claimed[recipient_];
    }
```

A problem arises that nowhere in the `CGDAIncentive:Claim` function is the recipient marked as claimed using the claimed mapping, allowing him to claim more as long as there are still more funds in the contract.

```Solidity
        function claim(
        address claimTarget,
        bytes calldata
    ) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
        claims++;

        // Calculate the current reward and update the state
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        cgdaParams.currentReward = reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay
            ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay
            : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;

        // Transfer the reward to the recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
        return true;
    }
```

## Impact
Loss of reward to those who were not intended for it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Towards the end of `CGDAIncentive:Claim` consider setting the `claimed[recipient_]` to true making sure the target does not claim again.
