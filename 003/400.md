# `CGDAIncentive::claim()` does not set `claimed[recipient] = true`

## Summary

Through CGDAIncentive, user can claim incentives based on the claim volume. To claim the incentive, user will have to claim and the call will go through the following code

```solidity
function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
        claims++;
        // @audit-issue we do not set claimed mapping as true here

        // Calculate the current reward and update the state
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        cgdaParams.currentReward = reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;

        // Transfer the reward to the recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
        return true;
    }
```

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue lies in not updating the following mapping which holds all the addresses that have claimed the incentive.

```solidity
/// @notice A mapping of address to claim status
    mapping(address => bool) public claimed;
```

This mapping is also checked in `_isClaimable(claimTarget)` which is called at the very start of the claim function.

```solidity
function _isClaimable(address recipient_) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        return reward > 0 && asset.balanceOf(address(this)) >= reward && !claimed[recipient_];
    }
```

This allows the user to reclaim again with a different signature as their address has not been marked as claimed.

## Impact

Allows reclaiming and lowering the reward for other users.
