# Solady Being Vuln To Sig Malleability + A missed Check On CGDA = An Issue

## Summary

Solday library SignatureCheckerLib unlike ECDSA by OZ is vulnerable to Signature Malleability ->

https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/main/src/utils/SignatureCheckerLib.sol#L23

But all in all this cant be exploited since incentives keep track of claimed[] mapping , so if you have claimed then you are marked as claimed so even if you claim again with a malleable sig the claim would revert since claimed[] is checked while claiming.

But, this claim checked is missed in CGDA Incentive.

Note: Any issue which lists just one of the above would be invalid since it needs the both of the issues to become a valid issue.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) A user who was eligible for an incentive claim calls claim here , assume incentive was CGDAIncentive ->

2.) The data gets validated in the Signer Validator ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L50

where the sig in the data is checked and validated , the data gets validated and the CGDAIncentive gets claimed (this is called by BoostCore's claimIncentive after validate() call)->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L85

but you can see the `claimed` mapping for the user has not been set to true . 

3.) Since the signature was malleable , another set of data can be provided which corresponds to the same hash and claim is called again by the attacker -> it validates -> and the CGDAIncentive claim  gets called again -> it checks if the claim is allowed ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L86

now since , claims is still false , the user claims the incentive again successfully using the malleable signature.



## Impact

The user can claim the CGDAIncentive twice due to the above describes issue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either add check to prohibit sig malleability of assign claims[] as true in the CGDA incentive
