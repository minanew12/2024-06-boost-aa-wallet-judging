# Unlimited claim reward in ERC20VariableIncentive

### Summary

The `claim` function in `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol` can be called again and again by user who already call the function.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20VariableIncentive.sol#L1

The contract doesn't keep a record of who already claims the reward. As a result, anyone who can claim the reward will be able to claim the reward again.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is a boost with ERC20VariableIncentive

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User notice there is a boost using ERC20VariableIncentive.
2. User done a task to be eligible for incentive reward.
3. User claim reward of that boost.
4. Repeat step 3 until user is satisfied or incentive reward is drained.

### Impact

Loss of funds for boost creator/owner as a user only needs to do possibly 1 task to claim all the reward for themselves.

### PoC
Add this test function in `ERC20VariableIncentive.t.sol`
```solidity
function testUnlimitedClaim() public {
        // Initialize the ERC20VariableIncentive
        _initialize(address(mockAsset), 1 ether, 5 ether);

        incentive.claim(CLAIM_RECIPIENT, _encodeBoostClaim(1 ether));
        incentive.claim(CLAIM_RECIPIENT, _encodeBoostClaim(1 ether));
        incentive.claim(CLAIM_RECIPIENT, _encodeBoostClaim(1 ether));
        incentive.claim(CLAIM_RECIPIENT, _encodeBoostClaim(1 ether));
        incentive.claim(CLAIM_RECIPIENT, _encodeBoostClaim(1 ether));


        assertEq(mockAsset.balanceOf(CLAIM_RECIPIENT), 5 ether);
    }
```

### Mitigation
In `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol`

1. Keep a record of addresses that have already claimed the reward. Add this in the `claim` function:
```solidity
claimed[claimTarget] = true;
```
2. Verify if address already claimed by changing the `_isClaimable` function.  Change the `_isClaimable` function to:
```solidity
    function _isClaimable(address recipient_) internal view returns (bool) {
        return !claimed[recipient_] && totalClaimed < limit;
    }
```
