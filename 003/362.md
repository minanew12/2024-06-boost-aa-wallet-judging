# Under certain circumstances, a user can claim their incentive more than once from CGDAIncentive

## Summary

Every time the function CGDAIncentive.claim is called, it first checks whether the recipient is eligible to receive a reward through the function _isClaimable(claimTarget). The problem is that the mechanism that verifies whether the recipient has already received a reward does not work properly, and under certain circumstances, a user can claim their incentive more than once, thereby draining the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function _isClaimable(address recipient_) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint256 reward = currentReward();
    return reward > 0 && asset.balanceOf(address(this)) >= reward && !claimed[recipient_];
}
```

As seen in the _isClaimable() function, one of the conditions to return true is !claimed[recipient_], which means that the recipient has not claimed a reward before. The problem is that in the claim function, claimed[recipient] = true is not set as it should be for this check to work properly. The requirement for this attack to be successful is to use a validator other than SignerValidator, which has a similar check. This is a completely possible scenario because in certain validator implementations, it is not possible to implement such functionality, and it is the responsibility of the encapsulated logic in CGDAIncentive to operate securely.

## Impact

Draining of the CGDAIncentive contract.
