# In `CGDAIncentive.sol`, rewards will increase even if less than an hour has passed after the last claim which is not intended by the protocol.

## Summary
The CDGAIncetive contract is supposed to reward claimants as part of the incentives in the protocol, it is supposed to increment the reward every hour that passes after a claim is made. But the way the increment is calculated makes it possible increment the reward to increase even if an hour has not passed.

## Vulnerability Detail
To incentivize users of boost protocol boosts, one of the incentive types used is a
CDAIncetive(Continuous Gradual Dutch Auction Incentive) and its logic is implemented in CDGAIncentive.sol.

In this incentive type, rewards depend on the rate of claiming reward. If a reward is claimed in the last hour, the reward is not supposed to be incremented. Every hour that passes, the reward is incremented based on the rewardBoost set in the initializer.

But the way the increment is calculated in `CGDAIncentive:currentReward()` makes it possible to increment the reward even if an hour has not passed or completed.

The cause of this issue is that the function first multiplies with the boost multiplier before calculating the hours that have elapsed.

```Solidity
    /// @return The current reward
    /// @dev The reward is calculated based on the time since the last claim, the available budget, and the reward parameters. It increases linearly over time in the absence of claims, with each hour adding `rewardBoost` to the current reward, up to the available budget.
    /// @dev For example, if there is one claim in the first hour, then no claims for three hours, the claimable reward would be `initialReward - rewardDecay + (rewardBoost * 3)`
    function currentReward() public view override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - cgdaParams.lastClaimTime;
        uint256 available = asset.balanceOf(address(this));

        // Calculate the current reward based on the time elapsed since the last claim
        // on a linear scale, with `1 * rewardBoost` added for each hour without a claim
        uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward +
            (timeSinceLastClaim * cgdaParams.rewardBoost) /
            3600;
        return projectedReward > available ? available : projectedReward;
    }
```

As you can see in the natspec of this function, the reward should be increment for every full hour that elapses after the last claim.

## Proof of concept
Lets consider two claims to this contract where:

cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = 259200;
blocktimestamp = 270,000;
cgdaParams.rewardBoost = 4000
cgdaParams.currentReward = 300000000000000000(3e16)
cgdaParams.rewardDecay = 20000000000000000(2e15)

When a call is made to the `CGDAIncentive:currentReward()`:
uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - cgdaParams.lastClaimTime;
uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = 270,000 - 259200
                                             = 10800 seconds
`Here three hours have passed since last claim`
 uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward + (timeSinceLastClaim * cgdaParams.rewardBoost) / 3600;
uint256 projectedReward = 3e16 + (10800 * 4000) / 3600
                                          = 300000000000012000(+12000)

So, the reward has increased by 12000 after 3 hours without a claim

Okay now 30 minutes by and another claimant decides to claim (Remember since they are 30 minutes passed the last claim, the current reward is not supposed to increased):
cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = 270,000;
blocktimestamp = 270,000 + 1800 = 271800;
cgdaParams.rewardBoost = 4000

`After each claim the reward is reduced by the rewardDecay`
cgdaParams.currentReward = 300000000000000000(3e16) - 20000000000000000(2e15) = 18000000000000000000(18e15)
cgdaParams.rewardDecay = 20000000000000000(2e15)

So a call is made to the `CGDAIncentive:currentReward()` to find the current reward:
uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - cgdaParams.lastClaimTime;
uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = 271800 - 270,000
                                             = 1800 seconds

`Here on 30 minutes have passed since last claim so the reward is not supposed to increment`
 uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward + (timeSinceLastClaim * cgdaParams.rewardBoost) / 3600;
uint256 projectedReward = 18000000000000000000(18e15) + (1800 * 4000) / 3600
                                          = 18000000000000002000(+2000)

AS you see above even after 30 minute, the reward has increased by 2000.


## Impact
More rewards will be distributed than the intended by the boost creator hence a loss of rewards

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `CGDAIncentive:currentReward()` should first divided by the 3600 seconds before multiplying by the  rewardBoost quantity to ensure that its multipying by hours.
