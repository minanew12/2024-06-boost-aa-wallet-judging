# a missing update which lead to for a user to clime  more than once

### Summary

in CGDAIncentive function  claim  line  86 checks if the  **claimTarget**  have  already  clamed or not and it checks it by calling the **_isClaimable** function  and in this function we can see 
```solidity

    function _isClaimable(address recipient_) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        return reward > 0 && asset.balanceOf(address(this)) >= reward && !claimed[recipient_];
    }
}     
```
**!claimed[recipient_]** need to be false always 
but the problem is that in the **claim function **       after transferring claimed[recipient_]  is not update to **TRUE**  which will lead to for user to clime    more than once 

### Root Cause

in CGDAIncentive function clime  doesn't update  **claimed[recipient_]**
