# Missing update of `claimed` status in `CGDAIncentive::claim`

### Summary

The `claimed` status of a `claimTarget` is not updated after a successful claim in the `CGDAIncentive::claim` function, allowing claimants to repeatedly claim rewards.


### Root Cause

In the `CGDAIncentive` contract, claimants are intended to claim rewards only once, as enforced by the [_isClaimable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L135) function:
```solidity
function _isClaimable(address recipient_) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint256 reward = currentReward();
    return reward > 0 && asset.balanceOf(address(this)) >= reward 
>>>        && !claimed[recipient_];
}
```
However, the issue arises because the `claimed` state is not updated after a successful claim, as shown in the code below:
```solidity
function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
    claims++;

    // Calculate the current reward and update the state
    uint256 reward = currentReward();
    cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    cgdaParams.currentReward =
        reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;

    // Transfer the reward to the recipient
    asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

>>>    // @audit `claimed[claimTarget]` is NOT updated
    emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
    return true;
}
```
Without updating `claimed[claimTarget]`, the contract fails to prevent multiple claims by the same claimant.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.


### External pre-conditions

None.


### Attack Path

- A claimant successfully claims rewards by calling `CGDAIncentive::claim`.
- Due to the missing update of the claimed status, the claimant is able to repeatedly claim rewards.

### Impact

The absence of updating `claimed[claimTarget]` after a successful claim allows claimants to claim rewards multiple times, potentially draining the contractâ€™s funds.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `claimed` status after successful claim:
```diff
function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
    claims++;

    // Calculate the current reward and update the state
    uint256 reward = currentReward();
    cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
    cgdaParams.currentReward =
        reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;

    // Transfer the reward to the recipient
    asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

+   claimed[claimTarget] = true;
    emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
    return true;
}
```
