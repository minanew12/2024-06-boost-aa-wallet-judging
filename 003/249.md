# No State Updation + Signature Malleability leads to critical loss of funds for the protocol

## Summary
CGDAIncentive does not update ``claimed`` mapping `` mapping(address => bool) public claimed;`` . This means that ``_isClaimable`` for a user will always return true. Combined with the fact that the protocol is using Solady's SignatureCheckerLib to verify signature, which is vulnerable for signature malleability, a malicious user can call claim multiple times. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume that we have a boost that is using ``CGDAIncentive .sol`` as an incentive contract. If a user is eligible for rewards then ``claimIncentiveFor`` is called with a signature.
```Solidity
  function claimIncentiveFor( 
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_, 
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, function is nonReentrant)
        if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```

Two things are happening here. 
First, the signature is validated ``boost.validator.validate`` which goes to ``SignerValidator.sol`` here
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L50-L75
As we can see that the function is using ``SignatureCheckerLib`` to verify the signature
```Solidity
 return validatorData.signer.isValidSignatureNow(hash, validatorData.signature);
```
which as per the comment, does not check for signature malleability
[```/// This implementation does NOT check if a signature is non-malleable.```](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/362b2efd20f38aea7252b391e5e016633ff79641/src/utils/SignatureCheckerLib.sol#L23)

Second, claim is called ``boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim``. If we see ``claim()`` function of ``CGDAIncentive.sol``
```Solidity

    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
        claims++;
        
  //@AUDIT mapping(address => bool) public claimed was never updated. 
  
        // Calculate the current reward and update the state
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        cgdaParams.currentReward =
            reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;

        // Transfer the reward to the recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
        return true;
    }
```

As we can see that ``claimed`` mapping was never updates. This means that this function can be called multiple times by a single user and ``_isClaimable`` will always returns true, since there's a check ``!claimed[recipient_]``

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L133-L136

Combining these two attack vectors:
A malicious user with a malleable signature can call claim multiple times draining the funds of the incentive contract entirely. 

## Impact
Critical loss of funds for protocol as well as users.
