# Incorrect calculation of `projectedReward` in `CGDAIncentive` results in linear reward increase per second instead of per hour

### Summary

In the `CGDAIncentive` contract, rewards are intended to increase linearly based on the number of hours passed since the last claim. However, [an incorrect formula in the `projectedReward` calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L129) results in rewards increasing per second, rather than per hour.


### Root Cause

The reward calculation in `CGDAIncentive` is based on the time since the last claim, the available budget, and specific reward parameters. **The rewards are designed to increase linearly for each hour** elapsed without a claim, with `rewardBoost` added to the current reward after each hour. However, the current formula miscalculates the time unit, as shown below:
```solidity
function currentReward() public view override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - cgdaParams.lastClaimTime;
    uint256 available = asset.balanceOf(address(this));

    // Calculate the current reward based on the time elapsed since the last claim
    // on a linear scale, with `1 * rewardBoost` added for each hour without a claim
        
>>>    uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward + (timeSinceLastClaim * cgdaParams.rewardBoost) / 3600;
    return projectedReward > available ? available : projectedReward;
}
```
The issue lies in how `projectedReward` is calculated:
```solidity
uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward + 
>>>    (timeSinceLastClaim * cgdaParams.rewardBoost) / 3600;
```
Here, `timeSinceLastClaim` is multiplied by `rewardBoost` and then divided by `3600`, which is incorrect. This calculation allows rewards to increase with every second, rather than being based on the number of full hours that have passed.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.


### External pre-conditions

None.


### Attack Path

- A reward claim is made at time `x`.
- A subsequent claim at `x + y seconds` (where `y` is less than an hour) results in an increased reward, even though a full hour has not passed.

### Impact

Rewards increase incorrectly at a per-second rate instead of per hour, leading to an unintended escalation of rewards.


### PoC

Assume the `rewardBoost` is set to` 0.1 ether`. 

- 30 minutes (`1800` seconds) have passed since the last claim, the `projectedReward` is calculated as follows:
`projectdReward = currentReward + (1800 * 0.1 ether) / 3600 = currentReward + 5e16 `.  
- Another 30 mintues are passed, the rewards will increase by `5e16` again.

At this point, an hour is passed with 2 claims in which the rewards were increased by `0.1 ether` (`5e16 * 2`), which is not intended, as rewards should only increase after full hours have passed without claims.

### Mitigation

Update the calculation of current rewards to:
```diff
function currentReward() public view override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - cgdaParams.lastClaimTime;
    uint256 available = asset.balanceOf(address(this));

    // Calculate the current reward based on the time elapsed since the last claim
    // on a linear scale, with `1 * rewardBoost` added for each hour without a claim
        
-   uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward + (timeSinceLastClaim * cgdaParams.rewardBoost) / 3600;
+   uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward + (timeSinceLastClaim / 3600) * cgdaParams.rewardBoost;
    return projectedReward > available ? available : projectedReward;
}
```
