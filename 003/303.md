# Missing Claimed State Update in CGDAIncentive

## Summary

In `CGDAIncentive.sol`, which inherits from `AIncentive.sol`, the `claimed` state variable meant to track claims is not updated in the `claim()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

`CGDAIncentive.sol::claim()` function fails to update the claimed mapping after transferring incentives to the claimant. This allows attackers to bypass the `_isClaimable()` check, which is supposed to ensure that the incentive cannot be claimed twice. As a result, malicious actors can claim rewards multiple times.

## Impact

The impact includes unauthorized multiple claims by an attacker.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the line claimed[claimTarget] = true; to the claim() function

```diff
function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable(); 
        claims++;

        // Calculate the current reward and update the state
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp; 
        cgdaParams.currentReward =
            reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;
    
++  claimed[claimTarget] = true; 
    
        // Transfer the reward to the recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward); 

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
        return true;
    }
```
