# CGDAIncentive: Accounts can claim multiple times which breaks strong invariant logic in _isClaimable() function

### Summary

User accounts that have claimed are not set to true using the `claimed` mapping: [defined here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/AIncentive.sol#L38). 

[CGDAIncentive.sol#L85C1-L100C6](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L85C1-L100C6)
 ```solidity
   function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
        claims++;

        // Calculate the current reward and update the state
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        cgdaParams.currentReward =
            reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;

        // Transfer the reward to the recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
        return true;
    }
```

This is an omission on your part I guess, but it is serious because a user can claim multiple times even though in _isClaimable() there is a strong condition to prevent users claiming more than once:

[CGDAIncentive.sol#L115](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L115)

```solidity
    function _isClaimable(address recipient_) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        return reward > 0 && asset.balanceOf(address(this)) >= reward && !claimed[recipient_];
    }
```

So _isClaimable is going to allow all claims from the same user as long as reward and asset balance are in range which breaks your invariant above in the _isClaimable().

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

Account needs to have claimed before then it will also be able to claim again bypassing the `isClaimable()` function's check.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Multiple claims from the same account may mean the dutch auction is less fair.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
