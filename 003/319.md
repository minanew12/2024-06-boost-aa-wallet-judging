# User can claim multiple times in CGDAIncentive contract

### Summary

`claim` function does not set `claimed[claimTarget] = true;` which allows multiple claims until the Incentive is drained.

### Root Cause

`claim` does not set `claimed[claimTarget] = true;` when tokens are sent to `claimTarget` address.

It is expected that `claimed[claimTarget] = true;` will be set to `true` after claim because it is checked in `_isClaimable` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Boost validator must allow multiple claims (future integrations are in scope for this contest, there could be validator that allows multiple claims but this Incentive clearly expects that it can be claimed once per address)

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Boost with validator that allows multiple claims is created
2. User executes action
3. Backend validator validates action off-chain
4. Backend validator creates signature for the user
5. User can claim incentive multiple times until Incentive is completely drained

### Impact

User can withdraw 100% funds from the Incentive.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `claimed[claimTarget] = true;` to `claim` function.

```diff
function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
        claims++;
++      claimed[claimTarget] = true;

        // Calculate the current reward and update the state
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        cgdaParams.currentReward =
            reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;

        // Transfer the reward to the recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
        return true;
    }
```
