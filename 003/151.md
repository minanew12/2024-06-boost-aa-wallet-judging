# CGDAIncentive.sol: Incorrect implementation of rewardDecay will lead to too high rewards

### Summary

The CGDA incentive grows linear based on the time passed. After each claim the reward is reduced by the `rewardDecay` set in the initializer function. This decay is not implemented correctly and does not allow rewards to drop lower than the `rewardDecay`. This will lead to higher rewards as intended. In case the tx fee is lower as the `rewardDecay`, users can continually call [CGDAIncentive.sol::claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L85-L100) to drain all tokens without using the intended linear growth.   

### Root Cause

In [CGDAIncentive.sol::claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L85-L100) the current reward is updated after each claim. This is done by reducing it like this:
```solidity
cgdaParams.currentReward = reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;
```

This is done to not let the function revert if `reward` is less than the `rewardDecay`. But it does not allow the `currentReward` to drop below `rewardDecay`, as it sets the `currentReward` to `rewardDecay` if the reward is less.

N/A

### Impact

The linear growth part of this incentive contract would not be used and users can spam claim transactions while still receiving the `rewardDecay` amount.

### PoC

The POC is based on the existing claim test, but the reward decay is increased to slow the effect more clearly. It can be seen how claim can be called again and again and the `currentReward` does not drop below the `rewardDecay` (set to 0.5 ether).

The diff below shows how to add it to the existing [CGDAIncentive.t.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/test/incentives/CGDAIncentive.t.sol) test:

### Mitigation

Change the update of `cgdaParams.currentReward` to set it to zero if the `reward` is not greater as the `cgdaParams.rewardDecay`. An example mitigation could look like this:

```diff
--- a/CGDAIncentive.sol.orig
+++ b/CGDAIncentive.sol
@@ -89,8 +89,7 @@ contract CGDAIncentive is AOwnable, ACGDAIncentive {
         // Calculate the current reward and update the state
         uint256 reward = currentReward();
         cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
-        cgdaParams.currentReward =
-            reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;
+        cgdaParams.currentReward = reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : 0;

         // Transfer the reward to the recipient
         asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);
```

With this the POC will fail, as the returned amount for `currentReward` is zero.
