# CDGA reward can be wrongly calculated when reward <= rewardDecay

### Summary

CDGA reward can be wrongly calculated when reward <= rewardDecay

### Root Cause

In the CGDA, the current reward decays by `rewardDecay` amount every time. However, a problem arises when the `currentReward <= rewardDecay`.

If the `reward <= rewardDecay`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L83-L99
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc AIncentive
    /// @notice Claim the incentive
    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
        claims++;

        // Calculate the current reward and update the state
        uint256 reward = currentReward();
        cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
        cgdaParams.currentReward =
            reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;

        // Transfer the reward to the recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
        return true;
    }
```

By right, using the formula if `currentReward <= rewardDecay`, then the new `currentReward` should be 0, however, it is incorrectly assigned to `rewardDecay` instead of 0

### Internal pre-conditions

`currentReward <= rewardDecay`

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

n/a

### Impact

Incorrect calculation of the CGDA rate, more rewards will be paid out then intended.
