# Loss of Rewards Due to Incorrect Reward Decay Handling in CGDAIncentive.sol

## Summary
Incorrect reward decay handling in CGDAIncentive.sol::claim() leads to a discrepancy in reward distribution, resulting in potential loss of incentives for users.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `claim()` function calculates the reward using the `currentReward()` function and then subtracts the reward decay to update `currentReward`. However, this logic may cause a loss of rewards over time due to the decay not being handled proportionally.

Hereâ€™s an example illustrating this issue:

Considering 0.1 ETH reward boost

1. Initial State:  USER 1 Claim 
    - Current reward: 2.1 ETH
    - Reward decay: 1 ETH
    
After the reward is claimed:
```solidity
cgdaParams.currentReward = reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;
```

   - New currentReward: 2.1 ETH - 1 ETH = 1.1 ETH

2. Second Claim: USER 2 Claim

     - Current reward: 1.2 ETH
     - Reward decay: 1 ETH
     
After the claim:

- New currentReward: 1.2 ETH - 1 ETH = 0.2 ETH

3. Third Claim: USER 3 Claim

    - Current reward: 0.2 ETH
    - Reward decay: 1 ETH
    
Since the reward is less than the decay, the function sets currentReward to the decay value:

- New currentReward: 1 ETH

4. Fourth Claim:

    - Current reward: 1.1 ETH
    - Reward decay: 1 ETH

Now the current reward = 1.1 ETH - 1 ETH = 0.1 ETH

From above claims
 
USER 1 got 2.1 ETH
USER 2 got 1.2 ETH
USER 3 got 0.2 ETH
USER 4 got 1.1 ETH
USER 5 will get 0.1 ETH
.
.
.

From above you can see USER 3 got less amount then USER 4 and this cycle will go on

Hence user will not get incentives correctly. This cyclic behavior results in significant loss of incentives for users and incorrect reward distribution.

## Impact

The improper handling of reward decay leads to a loss of rewards for users.

## Recommendation

Implement a more proportional reward decay mechanism or set a minimum reward threshold to avoid the cyclic loss of incentives and ensure fair distribution across all users.
