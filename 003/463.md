# Wrong Calculation Of Current Reward

## Summary
In `CGDAIncentive` in the `claim` function `currentReward` is wrongly set to `rewardDecay` when `rewardDecay` is bigger or equal to `reward`.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
cgdaParams.currentReward =
    reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;
```

`currentReward` is set using a ternary operator. In the case in which `reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay` is not true (or `reward <= cgdaParams.rewardDecay` is true), `currentReward` is set to `cgdaParams.rewardDecay`.

## Impact
Example scenario (using small numbers for simplification):
1. `reward` is equal to 50.
2. `rewardDecay` is equal to 75.
3. `currentReward` will be 75 instead of it being 50 making a loss for the protocol owner of 25 (which is 50% of 50) in this exact scenario.

As we can see setting `currentReward` to `rewardDecay` may have critical consequences to the calculation of `currentReward` enlarging it when it shouldn't.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
cgdaParams.currentReward =
    reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Depending on the desire of the protocol developers, two options are possible:

1. When `reward <= cgdaParams.rewardDecay`, `currentReward` can be set to 0:
```solidity
cgdaParams.currentReward =
    reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : 0;
```

2. When `reward <= cgdaParams.rewardDecay`, `currentReward` can be set to `reward`:
```solidity
cgdaParams.currentReward =
    reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : reward;
```
