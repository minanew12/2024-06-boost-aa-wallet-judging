# Lack of `limit` Validation Check in `ERC20Incentive::claim` Function Can Allow claims to Exceed the `limit`

### Summary

The `claim` function in the `ERC20Incentive` contract allows users to claim incentives. However, the function lacks a check to ensure that the total number of claims does not exceed the predefined limit, which represents the maximum number of allowed claims or entries. Without this check, the contract could permit more claims than intended, potentially leading to an over-distribution of rewards or recording more entries than there are available rewards. This oversight could result in inconsistencies and financial issues within the contract.


### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the lack of a validation check on the number of claims before incrementing the claim count.

### Impact

The protocol may over-distribute rewards or record more entries than the intended limit, which could result in financial loss or misallocation of funds, potentially putting the protocol at financial risk.

### Mitigation

I recommend the following change to avoid this issue :

```diff
function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();

+     require(claims < limit, "ClaimsLimitExceeded");

        if (strategy == Strategy.POOL) {
            claims++;
            claimed[claimTarget] = true;

            asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

            emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
            return true;
        } else {
            claims++;
            claimed[claimTarget] = true;
            entries.push(claimTarget);

            emit Entry(claimTarget);
            return true;
        }
    }
    ```
