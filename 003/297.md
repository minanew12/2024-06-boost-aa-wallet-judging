# Unlimited claim reward in CGDAIncentive

### Summary

The `claim` function in `CGDAIncentive.sol` can be called again and again by user who already claimed the reward.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20VariableIncentive.sol#L1

The contract validates if the recipient has already claimed the reward in the `_isClaimable` function using `claimed` variable but the `claimed` variable is never updated anywhere in the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is a boost with CGDAIncentive

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User notice there is a boost using ERC20VariableIncentive.
2. User done a task to be eligible for incentive reward.
3. User claim reward of that boost.
4. Repeat step 3 until user is satisfied or incentive reward is drained.

### Impact

Loss of funds for boost creator/owner as a user only needs to do possibly 1 task to claim all the reward for themselves.

### PoC

Add this test function in CGDAIncentive.t.sol

```solidity
    function test_unlimited_claim() public {
        
        address user = makeAddr("abc");
        console.log(asset.balanceOf(user));

        incentive.claim(user, hex"");
        incentive.claim(user, hex"");
        incentive.claim(user, hex"");
        incentive.claim(user, hex"");
        incentive.claim(user, hex"");
        incentive.claim(user, hex"");
        incentive.claim(user, hex"");
        incentive.claim(user, hex"");
        incentive.claim(user, hex"");
        incentive.claim(user, hex"");

        console.log(asset.balanceOf(user));
    }
```

### Mitigation

In `CGDAIncentive .sol`

Update the `claimed` variable of addresses that have already claimed the reward. Add this in the `claim` function:
```solidity
claimed[claimTarget] = true;
```
