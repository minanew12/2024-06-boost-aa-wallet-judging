# Improper Validation of Raffle Entries in `ERC20Incentive.clawback()` Allows Inaccurate Claim Tracking and Potential Exploits


## Summary
The `clawback()` function in the `ERC20Incentive` contract incorrectly relies on the `claims` counter to determine if there are no raffle entries, which breaks the intended behavior. This check is meant to ensure that there are no raffle entries before resetting the `limit`, but it incorrectly tracks the number of claims rather than the actual raffle entries.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation uses the `claims` variable in the following check:

```solidity
    function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload));
        (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));

        if (strategy == Strategy.RAFFLE) {
            // Ensure the amount is the full reward and there are no raffle entries, then reset the limit
@>          if (amount != reward || claims > 0) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));
            limit = 0;
        } else {
```

>             // Ensure the amount is the full reward and there are no raffle entries, then reset the limit

According to the above code comment, this check is intended to ensure that there are no raffle entries before resetting the `limit`. However, `claims` counts the number of claims made in all strategies, not just the `RAFFLE` strategy. Since raffle participants are stored in the `entries` array, this check does not accurately reflect whether there are any participants in the raffle, which could lead to incorrect fund clawback behavior.

### Scenario:
1. In the `POOL` strategy, claims are made, which increments the `claims` counter.
2. In the `RAFFLE` strategy, entries are added to the `entries` array.
3. When the `clawback()` function is called, the contract checks if `claims > 0`, but this does not accurately reflect whether any entries are in the raffle, as it only checks the global claims counter.

This discrepancy could lead to unintended behavior, such as resetting the `limit` while there are still active raffle entries.

## Impact
The code incorrectly reset the incentive's `limit` even if there are participants in the raffle, violating the contract's intended behavior and potentially causing unfair results in the raffle.

## Code Snippet
`if (amount != reward || claims > 0) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the `claims` check with a check on the actual raffle entries by using the `entries` array length:

```diff
    function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload));
        (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));

        if (strategy == Strategy.RAFFLE) {
            // Ensure the amount is the full reward and there are no raffle entries, then reset the limit
-           if (amount != reward || claims > 0) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));
+           if (amount != reward || entries.length > 0) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));
            limit = 0;
        } else {
```

This ensures that the contract correctly verifies the presence of raffle participants before resetting the `limit`.
