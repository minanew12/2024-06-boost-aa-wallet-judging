# ERC20Incentive reconsiders previous entries in case of raffle redraw

## Summary
The ERC20Incentive with strategy to be set to `RAFFLE`, allows transferring the reward to the winner. However, the `entries` array is not cleared after the raffle is drawn, allowing for a subsequent raffle with the same entries. If a redraw occurs, the previous entries will be considered again, which may not always be the desired behavior.


## Vulnerability Detail

### Preconditions 
The `drawRaffle()` function is called by the owner, which selects a winner randomly from the addresses in the `entries` array and transfers the reward to the selected address. While the contract will hold 0 reward tokens after this, the `entries` array will still retain all the previous participants.


### Description
If the same Incentive contract is refilled with `reward` tokens and the raffle is drawn again, new entries will be added to the `entries` array, which already contains previous entries.

When the owner calls `drawRaffle()` again, both the previous and new participants will be considered in the raffle, which is unfair to the new entrants as it reduces their chances of winning.

## Impact
New users will have lower chance of winning the raffle, because of the previous entries.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If you don't want to redraw of the raffle, set the `reward` or `limit` to 0.

```solidity
reward = 0;
```

Otherwise reset the `entries` array.

```solidity
delete entries;
```
