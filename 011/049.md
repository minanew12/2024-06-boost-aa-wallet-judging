# BoostCore.sol :: setProtocolFee() and setReferralFee() allow setting fees above the FEE_DENOMINATOR.

### Summary

**`setProtocolFee()`** and **`setReferralFee()`** allow fees to be set above the **`FEE_DENOMINATOR`**, which contradicts the protocol's specifications.

### Root Cause

[setProtocolFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L218-L220) and [setReferralFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L225-L227) allow the owner to set the fees allocated to the protocol and referrals. However, the issue is that these fees can be set above the [FEE_DENOMINATOR](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L73), which does not align with the protocol's specifications.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

There is no attack vector since the error is inherent in the code itself.

### Impact

Admins can set fees above the **`FEE_DENOMINATOR`**, which contradicts the protocol's specifications and results in the rules not being followed, thus violating the intended guidelines.

### PoC

As outlined in the protocol's README, it clearly states that the fees must fall within a specified range.

>Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?
BoostCore.sol::protocolFee = Between 0 - FEE_DENOMINATOR
BoostCore.sol::referralFee = Between 0 - FEE_DENOMINATOR

However, in the **`setProtocolFee()`** and **`setReferralFee()`**, these checks are not enforced, allowing owners to set fees without restriction.

To demonstrate the issue, copy the following POC into **`BoostCore.t.sol`**.
```Solidity
function testSetProtocolFeeAndReferralFeeAbove_FEE_DENOMINATOR() public {

        //FEE_DENOMINATOR is 10_000
        uint64 newProtocolFee = 20_000;
        uint64 newReferralFee = 20_000;

        boostCore.setProtocolFee(newProtocolFee);
        boostCore.setReferralFee(newReferralFee);

        assertEq(boostCore.protocolFee(), newProtocolFee);
        assertEq(boostCore.referralFee(), newReferralFee);
    }
```

### Mitigation

To address the issue, ensure that the new fees are checked to be within the specified range.
```diff
function setProtocolFee(uint64 protocolFee_) external onlyOwner {
+       require(protocolFee_ <= FEE_DENOMINATOR, "Fee not in range")
        protocolFee = protocolFee_;
    }
```
```diff
function setReferralFee(uint64 referralFee_) external onlyOwner {
+       require(referralFee_<= FEE_DENOMINATOR, "Fee not in range")
        referralFee = referralFee_;
    }
```
