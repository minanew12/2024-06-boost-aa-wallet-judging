# no check about `protocolFee` and `referralFee`

## Summary
There is no check about the value of `protocolFee` and `referralFee` when update
## Vulnerability Detail
In contract `boostCore.sol`, it doesn't check the value of  `protocolFee` and `referralFee`  when update.

```solidity
    function setProtocolFee(uint64 protocolFee_) external onlyOwner {
        protocolFee = protocolFee_; 
    }

    function setReferralFee(uint64 referralFee_) external onlyOwner {
        referralFee = referralFee_;
    }
```

According to the Detail page in sherlock, the` protocolFee` and `referralFee`  should between 0 and FEE_DENOMINATOR.
And if `referralFee` is larger than FEE_DENOMINATOR, it will cause `claimIncentive` revert when the referrer is not zero. 

```solidity
//In  _routeClaimFee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR; 
            // if referralFee is larger than FEE_DENOMINATOR, the referralShare  will larger than claimFee. 
            netFee -= referralShare; // will revert due to under overflow. 
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }
```
## Impact
This issue should be medium. Because the value `protocolFee` and `referralFee` will larger than FEE_DENOMINATOR which is contradicts what is stated in the Details page of sherlock. 
And it may cause `claimIncentive` not work which is a important function.
