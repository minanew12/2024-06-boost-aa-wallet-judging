# Budget accounting may fail for high-decimal tokens due to potential overflow

### Summary

The use of unbounded addition in the `total` function may cause a denial of service for budget users as accumulated distributions of high-decimal tokens could lead to an integer overflow, despite actions being performed by trusted roles.

### Root Cause

In `ManagedBudget.sol:280-282`, the total function adds available(asset_) and _distributedFungible[asset_] without considering potential overflow for tokens with more than 18 decimals:
```solidity
function total(address asset_) external view virtual override returns (uint256) {
    return available(asset_) + _distributedFungible[asset_];
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract must be managing a token with significantly more than 18 decimals.
2. The budget must have been operating for an extended period, accumulating a large value in _distributedFungible[asset_].

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Over time, authorized managers or admins allocate and disburse large amounts of a high-decimal token.
2. The _distributedFungible[asset_] value grows very large due to the token's high precision.
3. Eventually, available(asset_) + _distributedFungible[asset_] in the total function may overflow.
4. Any subsequent calls to total for that asset will revert due to overflow.

### Impact

The budget users cannot retrieve the total amount of assets allocated to the budget for the affected high-decimal token. This prevents proper accounting and may disrupt other contract functions that rely on the `total` function, potentially leading to a denial of service for operations involving that specific token.

### PoC

```solidity
function testOverflowInTotalWithHighDecimalToken() public {
    // Assume a token with 50 decimals
    MockERC20 highDecimalToken = new MockERC20("High Decimal Token", "HDT", 50);
    
    // Allocate a large amount of tokens (10^45)
    uint256 largeAmount = 1e45;
    highDecimalToken.mint(address(this), largeAmount);
    highDecimalToken.approve(address(budget), largeAmount);
    
    budget.allocate(abi.encode(ABudget.Transfer({
        assetType: ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
        asset: address(highDecimalToken),
        target: address(budget),
        data: abi.encode(ABudget.FungiblePayload({amount: largeAmount}))
    })));

    // Disburse the tokens
    budget.disburse(abi.encode(ABudget.Transfer({
        assetType: ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
        asset: address(highDecimalToken),
        target: address(0x1),
        data: abi.encode(ABudget.FungiblePayload({amount: largeAmount}))
    })));

    // Repeat allocation and disbursement to simulate long-term usage
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 240; i++) {
        budget.allocate(abi.encode(ABudget.Transfer({
            assetType: ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
            asset: address(highDecimalToken),
            target: address(budget),
            data: abi.encode(ABudget.FungiblePayload({amount: largeAmount}))
        })));

        budget.disburse(abi.encode(ABudget.Transfer({
            assetType: ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
            asset: address(highDecimalToken),
            target: address(0x1),
            data: abi.encode(ABudget.FungiblePayload({amount: largeAmount}))
        })));
    }

    // This call will revert due to overflow
    vm.expectRevert();
    budget.total(address(highDecimalToken));
}
```

### Mitigation

Implement a mechanism to periodically reset _distributedFungible[asset_] while maintaining accurate accounting:
```solidity
function resetDistributedAmount(address asset_) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) {
    _distributedFungible[asset_] = 0;
    emit DistributedAmountReset(asset_);
}
```
For tokens with extremely high decimals, consider storing and operating on scaled-down values internally, while providing interfaces that work with the full-precision values:
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) private _scaledDistributedFungible;
mapping(address => uint8) private _assetDecimals;

function scaleDown(address asset_, uint256 amount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint8 decimals = _assetDecimals[asset_];
    if (decimals <= 18) return amount;
    return amount / 10**(decimals - 18);
}

function scaleUp(address asset_, uint256 amount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint8 decimals = _assetDecimals[asset_];
    if (decimals <= 18) return amount;
    return amount * 10**(decimals - 18);
}
```
By implementing one of these mitigations, the contract can better handle high-decimal tokens and prevent potential overflows in long-term operations, even when managed by trusted roles.
