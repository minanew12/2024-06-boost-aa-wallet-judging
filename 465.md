# User could validate one action twice, using malleable hash

### Summary

`SignerValidator.sol` validator use SignatureCheckerLib from solady package. This library dont check, that hash is malleable. Therefore, user could create second (different) signature(if he has one) and validata again his executed action. And get 2 rewards for 1 action.

### Root Cause

In 'SignerValidator.sol:6' uses library from solady package, which dont have protection from malleable attack. If you open code of this library, you can read aboit it in comment - https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/362b2efd20f38aea7252b391e5e016633ff79641/src/utils/SignatureCheckerLib.sol#L23
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L6

SignerValidator contract calculate storage slot, usgin hash (as we know it could be different for the same values due to  malleable attack) for storing bits (is incentive has validated or not).
```solidity

 function setOrThrow(IncentiveMap storage bitmap, bytes32 hash, uint256 incentive) internal {
        bytes4 invalidSelector = BoostError.IncentiveToBig.selector;
        bytes4 claimedSelector = BoostError.IncentiveClaimed.selector;
        /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
        assembly {
            if gt(incentive, 7) {
                // if the incentive is larger the 7 (the highest bit index)
                // we revert
                mstore(0, invalidSelector)
                mstore(4, incentive)
                revert(0x00, 0x24)
            }
            mstore(0x20, bitmap.slot)
            mstore(0x00, hash)
            let storageSlot := keccak256(0x00, 0x40)
            // toggle the value that was stored inline on stack with xor
            let updatedStorageValue := xor(sload(storageSlot), shl(incentive, 1))
            // isolate the toggled bit and see if it's been unset back to zero
            let alreadySet := xor(1, shr(incentive, updatedStorageValue))
```

So, if user execute one action, get signature and call claimIncentive() twice with different hashes, he get 2 rewards.

### Internal pre-conditions

Boost uses SignerValidator.sol as validator

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Creator create boost with validator SignerValidator.sol
User execute 1 action
User get signature
User call call claimIncentive() twice with different hashes


### Impact

User get 2 rewards for 1 action

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use library from openzeppelin
