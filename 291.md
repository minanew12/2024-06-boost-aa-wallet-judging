# A malicious user can execute a tx on `ERC20VariableIncentive::claim` that can drain the whole balance of asset rewards of the contract `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol`

## Summary
A malicious user can execute a tx on `ERC20VariableIncentive::claim` that can drain the whole balance of asset rewards of the contract `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `ERC20VariableIncentive::claim` user has the potential to set `signedAmount` anything he want until it is less than the balance of `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol` contract and is less than `totalClaimed` check, so that the transaction don't get reverted. 

In `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol` => function `claim` =>

```solidity
    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        BoostClaimData memory boostClaimData = abi.decode(data_, (BoostClaimData));
@>      uint256 signedAmount = abi.decode(boostClaimData.incentiveData, (uint256));
        uint256 claimAmount;
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();

        if (reward == 0) {
            claimAmount = signedAmount;
        } 
       // when reward is set to non-zero amount
        else {
            // NOTE: this is assuming that the signed scalar is in ETH decimal format
            claimAmount = reward * signedAmount / 1e18;
        }

        if (totalClaimed + claimAmount > limit) revert ClaimFailed();

        totalClaimed += claimAmount;
  @>      asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, claimAmount);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, claimAmount));
        return true;
    }
```
Therefore a malicious user can pass `data_` with demonstrating a amount that is less than the balance of `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol` contract and is less than `totalClaimed` check, so that the transaction doesn't get reverted.

User Flow, which will not revert and will steal the maximum reward asset from the contract, due to not checking `abi.decode(boostClaimData.incentiveData, (uint256));` correctly to be appropriate according to the logic.

Here's the user flow ->
User will pass `bytes calldata data_` the amount he want to drain as discussed above: 
```solidity 
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
@>        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, function is nonReentrant)
@>        if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized(); 
@>        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```

Here in this function `boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)` will also not revert as there is no specific mentioned check where it restricts the `data_`
to include a restricted and appropriate `struct BoostClaimData` that has `bytes incentiveData;` , which user sets here.
## Impact
A malicious user can execute a tx on `ERC20VariableIncentive::claim` that can drain the whole balance of asset rewards of the contract `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol`
