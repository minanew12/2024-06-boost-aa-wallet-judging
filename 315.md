# Attacker can front run `register` function leading to loss of funds

### Summary

In BoostRegistry the `register` function takes type, name and implementation address as parameters. It creates identifier using type and name and uses it as the key to implementation address in a mapping. The issues is that anyone can call this function with same type and name and the identifier will be the same. Attacker can front-run the user (which tries to register legitimate address) and pass an address of his malicious implementation. Created identifier will be the same and newly created base implementation can be used by boost creators thinking the contract address behaves as expected. In reality the attacker can fully drain newly created boost.

### Root Cause

```javascript
function register(RegistryType type_, string calldata name_, address implementation_)
        external
        onlyACloneables(implementation_)
    {
        bytes32 identifier = getIdentifier(type_, name_);

        if (address(_bases[identifier]) != address(0)) revert AlreadyRegistered(type_, identifier);
        _bases[identifier] = ACloneable(implementation_);

        emit Registered(type_, identifier, implementation_);
    }
```

The issue is that register function creates the same identifier for every user which calls the function with the same type and name. There is no uniqe value passes into `getIdentifier` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. Attacker sees user's transaction in mempool and front-runs it with his malicious implementation

### Attack Path

1. Legitimate user calls `register` function with `type` 3, `name` "airdrop" and his base implementation.
2. Attacker sees user's transaction and front-runs it with the same type and name but different base implementaion address.
3. Malicious implementation is mapped to newly created identfier that the user tried to use for registration.
4. Boost creator which trusts the legitimate user creates the boost with incentive base implementation created by attacker.
5. Boost is created and attacker (non-whitelisted user) can drain the budget using his implementation.

### Impact

The boost can be created with malicious base implemenetation and be drained up to 100% of the available funds.

### PoC

`getIdentifier` does not use any uniqe value in identifier creation.

```javascript
/// @notice Build the identifier for a base implementation
    /// @param type_ The base type for the implementation
    /// @param name_ The name of the implementation
    /// @return identifier The unique identifier for the implementation
    function getIdentifier(RegistryType type_, string calldata name_) public pure returns (bytes32 identifier) {
        return _getIdentifier(type_, keccak256(abi.encodePacked(name_)));
    }

    /// @notice Build a unique identifier for a given type and hash
    /// @param type_ The base type for the implementation
    /// @param hash_ The unique hash for the implementation
    /// @return identifier The unique identifier for the implementation
    function _getIdentifier(RegistryType type_, bytes32 hash_) internal pure returns (bytes32 identifier) {
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(type_, hash_));
    }
```

### Mitigation

Create the identifier in the same way as `getCloneIdentifier` is created. It adds `msg.sender` into creation. It prevents `register` function from being front-run with malicious base implementation.
