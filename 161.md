# Silent Failure on Unsupported Asset Types in `SimpleBudget#allocate()`, `clawback()`, and `disburse()` Functions Could Result in Financial Issues for Integrators

## Summary

The `SimpleBudget` contract has a critical issue where unsupported asset types are not handled as documented. Functions like `allocate()`, `clawback()`, and `disburse()` silently return false when dealing with unsupported assets instead of reverting the transaction. This discrepancy between the actual behavior and the expected behavior (as described in the inline documentation) can mislead integrators. They might implement error handling with `try/catch` blocks, assuming transactions will revert on failure, but since the contract does not revert for unsupported asset types, integrators could incorrectly assume that unsupported asset allocations, clawbacks, or disbursements are successful. This silent failure can lead to unintended financial outcomes, including asset mismanagement or loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `allocate`, `clawback`, and `disburse` functions are designed to handle native assets (ETH), ERC20 tokens, and ERC1155 tokens. If an unsupported asset type is provided in the `Transfer` request, these functions return `false` without reverting the transaction or providing any error indication that would be caught in a `try-catch` block by integrators. This could lead to a misinterpretation by developers, who may assume the asset allocation or transfer was successful even though it was not.

The issue arises from the fact that while the inline documentation [states](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/SimpleBudget.sol#L65) that the expected functionality is that if an asset transfer fails, the allocation should revert, the functions instead silently return `false` when an unsupported asset type is provided.

## Impact

Integrators using a `try-catch` mechanism for handling failed transactions may incorrectly interpret the absence of a revert as a successful asset allocation or transfer. This could lead to improper asset management, incorrect assumptions about allocated funds, and potential financial discrepancies in applications interacting with the budget.

## Recommendation

To address this issue, it is recommended to modify the behavior for unsupported asset types in the `allocate`, `clawback`, and `disburse` functions to revert the transaction instead of returning `false`.
