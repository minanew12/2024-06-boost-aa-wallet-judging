# Assertion statement leading to excessive gas consumption and potential fund loss for users

## Summary
The `BoostCore` contract contains an issue where the use of the `assert` statement instead of `require` in production code can cause users to lose money due to unintended gas consumption. This can result in users paying for gas that should have been saved, particularly when a condition fails that should revert the transaction efficiently.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the current implementation, the `assert` statement is used in the following code snippet:

[BoostCore#L285](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L285)

```solidity
  function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
            {
            ...
            if (preflight.length != 0) {
                // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
@>              assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
            }
            ...
   }
```
The issue with using `assert` is that, when the condition fails, it consumes all remaining gas, leading to excessive gas costs for users. This is particularly problematic in a production environment, as `assert` is meant for testing, and its use in live contracts can inadvertently lead to financial losses for users.

By contrast, using a `require` statement would revert the transaction with minimal gas consumption and provide a clear error message. This ensures the contract fails safely and efficiently in production environments without penalizing users with unnecessary gas fees.

## Impact
**Financial Loss:** The use of `assert` results in all remaining gas being consumed when the condition fails, causing users to pay more than necessary.

## Tool used
VSCode

## Recommendation
Replace the `assert` statement with a `require` statement to avoid unintended gas consumption and ensure proper transaction handling in production environments:

```solidity
require(budget_.disburse(preflight), "Disbursement failed");
```
