# Flawed preflight Implementations

## Summary


## Vulnerability Detail
The `currentReward` function, which calculates the dynamic reward amount, doesn't explicitly check if the projected reward exceeds the total budget (`totalBudget`). This creates a scenario where the reward can grow unchecked over time, potentially depleting a significant portion of the budget before later claimants can participate.

- Exploitation Scenario:

Contract Setup: Imagine the CGDAIncentive contract is deployed with the following parameters:

totalBudget = 1000 tokens (the total amount to be given out)
initialReward = 10 tokens (the starting reward amount)
rewardDecay = 1 token (how much the reward decreases after each claim)
rewardBoost = 5 tokens per hour (how much the reward increases every hour without a claim)
- Quiet Period: Let's say a significant amount of time passes, for example, 100 hours, where no one claims any rewards. This could happen for various reasons:

People aren't aware of the incentive.
The initial reward is too low to be attractive.
Some participants are strategically waiting for the reward to grow.
- Reward Inflation: During these 100 hours of inactivity, the currentReward keeps increasing linearly:

Every hour, it goes up by rewardBoost (5 tokens).
Since there are no claims, there's no rewardDecay.
- The Catch: The crucial problem is that the code doesn't stop the reward from growing beyond the totalBudget. After 100 hours, the calculated currentReward would be:

currentReward = 10 (initial) + (100 hours * 5 tokens/hour) = 510 tokens
Early Bird Advantage: Now, an attacker who understands this flaw can swoop in. They see that the currentReward (510 tokens) is significantly larger than the initial reward and even a good chunk of the totalBudget. They claim the reward, receiving a disproportionately large amount.

Latecomers Disadvantaged: Anyone who comes after the attacker is left with a much smaller reward pool (less than half in this case). If the attacker claimed the entire remaining balance, subsequent users would get nothing.

Attacker's Advantage:

An attacker could potentially monitor deployed CGDAIncentive contracts and identify those with a high rewardBoost and a period of inactivity. They could then exploit the vulnerability by claiming the inflated reward before others, gaining an unfair advantage.

## Impact
Later claimants, who were unaware of the inflated reward or waited for a more favorable rate, are left with a much smaller reward pool or even nothing at all.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the currentReward function, add a check to ensure that the calculated projectedReward doesn't exceed totalBudget:
```Solidity
function currentReward() public view override returns (uint256) {
    // ... existing calculation ...

    uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward + (timeSinceLastClaim * cgdaParams.rewardBoost) / 3600;

    // Cap projectedReward at totalBudget
    return projectedReward > totalBudget ? totalBudget : projectedReward; 
}
```
