# Time Manipulation Vulnerability in Reward Calculation of `currentReward` Function

## Summary
The `currentReward` function in the `CGDAIncentive` contract is susceptible to manipulation due to its reliance on `block.timestamp` for reward calculations. This can lead to inaccurate reward distributions, allowing malicious actors to claim higher rewards than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
Root Cause:
- The `currentReward` function calculates the reward based on the time elapsed since the last claim using `block.timestamp`.
- Miners can manipulate `block.timestamp` to some extent, which can affect the reward calculation.
```solidity
123:     function currentReward() public view override returns (uint256) {
124:@=>      uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - cgdaParams.lastClaimTime;
125:         uint256 available = asset.balanceOf(address(this));
---
129:@=>      uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward + (timeSinceLastClaim * cgdaParams.rewardBoost) / 3600;
130:         return projectedReward > available ? available : projectedReward;
131:     }
```

## Impact
- Time manipulation can lead to unfair reward distribution.
- Malicious actors can claim larger rewards than they should.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement mechanisms to limit time manipulation and ensure reward calculations are more resilient to block time changes.
```diff
function currentReward() public view override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - cgdaParams.lastClaimTime;
-   uint256 available = asset.balanceOf(address(this));
+   uint256 maxTimeAllowed = 3600 * 24; // Maximum 24 hours

    // Limit acceptable time to avoid manipulation
+   if (timeSinceLastClaim > maxTimeAllowed) {
+       timeSinceLastClaim = maxTimeAllowed;
    }

+   uint256 available = asset.balanceOf(address(this));

    // Calculate current rewards based on limited time
    uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward + (timeSinceLastClaim * cgdaParams.rewardBoost) / 3600;
    
    // Make sure the prize does not exceed the available balance.
    return projectedReward > available ? available : projectedReward;
}
```
