# SimpleAllowList::setAllowed() cannot be called from AllowListIncentive contract

## Summary
See below.
## Vulnerability Detail
If AllowListIncentive contract is set as incentive in a Boost then when AllowListIncentive::claim() is called from BoostCore::claimIncentive() the claim() of AllowListIncentive contract calls setAllowed() of SimpleAllowlist contract. If we see the  SimpleAllowlist::setAllowed() the caller of this function must have LIST_MANAGER_ROLE, as this role is assigned to the owner only, during initialization of SimpleAllowlist contract, the call from AllowListIncentive::claim() to SimpleAllowlist::setAllowed() will revert because the AllowListIncentive is not owner.
## Impact
The transaction for claim will revert in SimpleAllowList::setAllowed().

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow the incentive contract to call that function by assigning a role.
