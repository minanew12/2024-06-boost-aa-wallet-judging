# Frontrunning Vulnerability in `CGDAIncentive.sol's` Reward Claiming Mechanism

## Summary
A frontrunning vulnerability exists in the reward claiming mechanism of `CGDAIncentive.sol`, where an attacker can claim rewards ahead of a legitimate user, reducing the latter's reward.

## Vulnerability Detail

Frontrunning is possible on different EVM compatible chains

The vulnerability occurs when a user attempts to claim rewards from `CGDAIncentive.sol`. The rewards are calculated based on the current rewards and elapsed time since the last claim, using the following formula:

```solidity
uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward + (timeSinceLastClaim * cgdaParams.rewardBoost) / 3600;
```
This formula increases the reward over time as long as no one claims it. However, this creates an opportunity for an attacker to frontrun the transaction.

Hereâ€™s how the attack works:

An attacker can look at mempool and wait so that rewards will increase. and as soon as someone calls claim attacker frontruns the transaction and puts the transaction above the victim's transaction. Now `cgdaParams.lastClaimTime` will be set to `block.timestamp` and hence victim will not get reward boost + now after the attacker's claim reward decay will decrease the `cgdaParams.currentReward` and hence it will cause loss for the victim and profile for the attacker.

## Impact

Loss for the victim: The legitimate user receives a reduced reward after the attacker claims first.
