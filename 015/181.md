# CGDAIncentive Claim Can Be frontRun So That Victim Receives Way Lesser (even 0) Claims

## Summary

The CGDAIncentive is dependent on the lastClaimTime , the more the difference between current time and the lastClaimTime , more the rewards , but an attacker can frontrun victim's claim with his claim makin the difference for the victim to be 0 and now victim either receives way lesser incentive or maybe even 0 incentive.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) Alice completes an action for which the incentive was a CGDAIncentive , Bob has also completed this action similarly, both are now eligible to claim the incentive.

2.) Bob notices Alice is also eligible , Alice submits her `claimIncentive`  tx ->

this would call the claim in the CGDAIncentive contract

3.) Bob frontruns the above tx by Alice with his claimIncentive tx , therefore Bob's claimIncentive executes before , and when claim is
executed in the CGDAIncentive for Bob ->

This would reset the `lastClaimTime` to current timestamp ->

4.) Now Alice's claim tx executes , when her reward is calculated in the CGDAIncentive the time difference would be calculated as 0 since Bob updated the `lastClaimTime` to current timestamp ->

Therefore the projected reward would be way lesser than expected for Alice ->

## Impact

Alice receives way lesser incentives than intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Alice should specify a threshold of rewards while claiming , something like a slippage.
