# claimIncentiveFor Might Lead To Loss Of Funds For CGDA Incentive

## Summary

The protocol has introduces a functionality to claim an incentive for other claimants , this would require data for the claim and according to the sponsor (asked in thread) -> `Signatures are available publicly by way of API` , so this way I can claim for someone else , it's a neat feature but for CGDA incentive can be disastrous.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) Alice completes an action and for this action the incentive was a CGDAIncentive , the off chain mechanism verifies that Alice has performed the action successfully and grants her the claim , the claim as mentioned `Signatures are available publicly by way of API` 

2.) Alice has a valid claim now for the CGDAIncentive , but she wants to wait for some time to claim since CGDA is dependent on lastClaimTime and she wants to maximise her gains , she wants to wait for 5 more blocks.

3.) Bob comes and claims the incentive for Alice earlier ->

He does it such that Alice would get lesser incentive due to `uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - cgdaParams.lastClaimTime;` being smaller than Alice intended and hence the rewards sent would be lesser

4.) Alice lost her incentives , she wanted to claim after 5 blocks and make maximum gains , but Bob ruined her returns.


## Impact

Alice will get way lesser incentives than intended due to Bob claiming on her behalf.

Done let users cliam for other for such time dependent incentives.
