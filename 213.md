# In `ManagedBudget`, the usage of `SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH` will cause Out of Gas when disbursing ETH to a malicious contract

### Summary

In `ManagedBudget`, the usage of `SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH` when disbursing ETH will cause Out of Gas to a malicious contract.

### Root Cause

In `ManagedBudget`, the usage of `SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH` when disbursing ETH to a recipient

```solidity
    function _transferFungible(address asset_, address to_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual nonReentrant {
        // Increment the total amount of the asset distributed from the budget
        if (to_ == address(0)) revert TransferFailed(asset_, to_, amount_);
        if (amount_ > available(asset_)) {
            revert InsufficientFunds(asset_, available(asset_), amount_);
        }

        _distributedFungible[asset_] += amount_;

        // Transfer the asset to the recipient
        if (asset_ == address(0)) {
>>          SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(to_, amount_);
        } else {
            asset_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_);
        }

        emit Distributed(asset_, to_, amount_);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Since none of the incentive contracts is supported for distributing ETH, we are assuming that the boost creator will send ETH directly from `ManagedBudget` to a recipient using `disburse`

1. The boost creator `allocate` ETH to `ManagedBudget`
2. The attacker completes the required actions
3. The attacker provides a malicious contract for the boost creator
4. The boost creator `disburse` ETH with `request.target` is equal to the address of the malicious contract
5. The malicious contract spends all gas of the boost creator

The implementation of the malicious contract:

```solidity
contract Attacker {
  receive() external payable {
    while(true) {}
  }
}
```

### Impact

The boost creator loses all gas.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `forceSafeTransferETH` instead of `safeTransferETH`

```diff
    function _transferFungible(address asset_, address to_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual nonReentrant {
        // Increment the total amount of the asset distributed from the budget
        if (to_ == address(0)) revert TransferFailed(asset_, to_, amount_);
        if (amount_ > available(asset_)) {
            revert InsufficientFunds(asset_, available(asset_), amount_);
        }

        _distributedFungible[asset_] += amount_;

        // Transfer the asset to the recipient
        if (asset_ == address(0)) {
-           SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(to_, amount_);
+           SafeTransferLib.forceSafeTransferETH(to_, amount_, 5000);
        } else {
            asset_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_);
        }

        emit Distributed(asset_, to_, amount_);
    }
```
