# `claimed` mapping is not updated in `CGDAIncentive#claim` and `ERC20VariableIncentive#claim`

### Summary

`claimed` mapping is not updated in `CGDAIncentive#claim` and `ERC20VariableIncentive#claim`

### Root Cause

It is evidence that in other incentive contracts, the `claimed` mapping is updated to reflect the claim status of an address

But in the `CGDAIncentive#claim` and `ERC20VariableIncentive#claim`, the `claimed` mapping is not updated

We believe the missing update for the `claimed` mapping will break the codebase's expected functionality provided in the code comments in the `AIncentive.sol` contract, which is an in-scope contract

```solidity
    /// @notice A mapping of address to claim status
    mapping(address => bool) public claimed;
```

Per the Sherlock's rules

> The protocol team can use the README (and only the README) to define language that indicates the codebase's restrictions and/or expected functionality. Issues that break these statements, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, will be assigned Medium severity.
