# The initial payload that used to deploy and start the boost in boost core missing deny list

## Summary

The initial payload that used to deploy and start the boost in boost core missing deny list

```solidity
    struct InitPayload {
        ABudget budget;
        BoostLib.Target action;
        BoostLib.Target validator;
        BoostLib.Target allowList;
        BoostLib.Target[] incentives;
        uint64 protocolFee;
        uint64 referralFee;
        uint256 maxParticipants;
        address owner;
    }
```

## Vulnerability Detail

The initial payload that used to deploy and start the boost in boost core missing deny list

## Impact

While the deny list is in scope and even the boost owner build a deny list, it can't be used to deny certain user entry to boost.

deny list and allow list should have different use case.

user allow list to achieve deny list is not possible.

for example,

the boost owner may only want to deny three address's entry to boost,

but the boost owner cannot whitelist every single address other than the blocklisted three address because there are so many address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Denylist is not in the initial payload when create boost
