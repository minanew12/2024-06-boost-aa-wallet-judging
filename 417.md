# Unrestricted Validator Caller

## Details

The Boost protocol uses the AValidator contract and its implementations, such as the SignerValidator, to verify that a user has met the requirements to claim an incentive for a boost. The validate function is the primary method used to perform this verification.

A potential security vulnerability exists in how the validate function in AValidator and its implementations, like SignerValidator, can be called. Currently, any address can call the validate function, as there are no access control restrictions in place.

## Code Snippets
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/AValidator.sol#L17
```solidity
// AValidator.sol
/// ...
/// @notice Validate that a given user has completed an action successfully
/// ...
/// @return True if the action has been validated based on the data payload
/// @dev The decompressed payload contains freeform bytes that are entirely implementation-specific
function validate(uint256 boostId, uint256 incentiveId, address claimant, bytes calldata data)
    external
    virtual
    returns (bool);
/// ...
```

The external keyword in the function declaration signifies that any external address can call this function.

## Impact

The lack of access control on the validate function could lead to several issues:

Unauthorized Incentive Claims: Malicious actors could directly call the validate function with fabricated data, bypassing the intended action completion requirements and claiming incentives without authorization.
Denial of Service: Malicious actors could flood the validator contract with invalid requests, potentially consuming excessive gas and disrupting legitimate boost participants from claiming incentives.

## Scenario

An attacker identifies a boost with valuable incentives and observes the AValidator implementation being used.
The attacker crafts a call to the validate function with arbitrary data, including a false boostId, incentiveId, and claimant (their own address).
Without any access control, the validate function executes and potentially returns true based on the attacker's fabricated data.
The attacker uses the successful validation result to claim an incentive they are not eligible for.

## Fix

To mitigate this vulnerability, the validate function should be restricted to only allow calls from authorized addresses, such as the BoostCore contract.

Here are two potential approaches for implementing this fix:

Access Control Modifier in AValidator: Introduce a modifier within AValidator (and its implementations) to check if the caller is authorized. This modifier would use a mapping of authorized addresses, which can be managed (e.g., by the BoostCore contract or through governance).

Internal Function and BoostCore Interaction: Change the validate function to internal. Modify BoostCore to call the validate function directly within its claimIncentive function. This approach centralizes the access control to BoostCore, ensuring only the intended contract can trigger validation.
