# Boost.maxParticipants does not limit the number of participants of a boost

### Summary

The `maxParticipants` value from the Boost is supposed to limit the participation of a boost. However, currently `maxParticipants` does not has any effect on the number of participation of a certain boost.

### Root Cause

There is no logic that limit the number of participations. The use of the `maxParticipants` variable is only in the `createBoost`  function which only initialize the `maxParticipants` value of the boost.

### Impact

Creator of a boost cannot limit the number of participation in their boost which is a core functionality.

### PoC

1. Open EndToEndBasic.t.sol
2. Change line 340 from 5 to 0. This should change the `maxParticipants` value of the boost to 0 which should fail the `test__As_a_user ` test
3. Run `forge test`
4. See that `test__As_a_user` test passed

### Mitigation

Implement the boost participation limit logic using the `maxParticipants` value from a boost.
