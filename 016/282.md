# In `AllowListIncentive::claim`, non-allowed addresses can "claim slots on the {SimpleAllowList}", increasing `claims` unfairly and reaching the `limit` sooner, blocking honest users from claiming.

## Summary
In function `AllowListIncentive::claim` non-allowed addresses can also "Claim slots on the {SimpleAllowList}" increasing the `claims` that have been made, which will lead in reaching the `limit` sooner in an unfair way, preventing the honest users from claiming slots, once the `limit` has reached unfairly.
## Vulnerability Detail
`AllowListIncentive::claim` does not implement the `isClaimable` function check due to which an edge case for non-allowed addresses opens, which lets them claim the slot, even when they were not meant to be allowed.

The current check inside function `claim` =>
```solidity
    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
@>      if (claims++ >= limit || claimed[claimTarget]) revert NotClaimable();
        claimed[claimTarget] = true;

        (address[] memory users, bool[] memory allowed) = _makeAllowListPayload(claimTarget);

        allowList.setAllowed(users, allowed);
        return true;
    }
```

This check does not implement all the checks that were supposed to be made in order to correctly check whether the `address claimTarget` is perfectly eligible to claim or not. 

This check fails to check whether the `address claimTarget` is already true for the function  `SimpleAllowList::isAllowed`, because if in case it is already true then, the `address claimTarget` should not be able to claim as he already has the spot in SimpleAllowList.

In `SimpleAllowList::initialize` an array of addresses is set to `true` for `allowed` mapping, which also represents the function `isAllowed` =>

```solidity

@>  mapping(address => bool) internal _allowed;

    function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public virtual override initializer {
        (address owner_, address[] memory allowList_) = abi.decode(data_, (address, address[]));
        _initializeOwner(owner_);
        _grantRoles(owner_, LIST_MANAGER_ROLE);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < allowList_.length; i++) {
@>          _allowed[allowList_[i]] = true;
        }
    }

@>  function isAllowed(address user_, bytes calldata /* data_ - unused */ ) external view override returns (bool) {
        return _allowed[user_];
    }
```

Now these addresses which are set to `true` in the initialize function itself, can call the function `claimIncentiveFor` (This is a public function and not an onlyOwner function) on `BoostCore.sol` in order to claim the slot by `AllowListIncentive::claim` =>

```solidity
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, function is nonReentrant)
        if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
@>      if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```

## Proof of Concept

`AllowListIncentive.sol` =>

Here just taking a small example by setting the values in real numbers to explain the issue: 
- limit = 10 (meaning only 10 claims can be made by the one who has completed the action and is eligible to claim)

- 5 Users who are already set to `true` for `allowed` mapping  due to `SimpleAllowList::initialize` , came in and performed the specific action in order to get validated and later called `BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor`

- Now here all these 5 users' tx will be successful (due to lack of check) and `claims` will be increased by 5 (ie. claims = 5)

- Now only 5 `claims` are remaining for honest users to claim the slot, so in an unfair way, the `claims` for honest users have significantly decreased in this case.

- So here, the other honest users who would have fairly claimed the slots got hindered/prevented.

## Impact
Honest users who performed the action in order to claim, won't be able to claim, once the `limit` has been reached unfairly by the non-allowed addresses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To have an additional check, with prior checks available in the function where all non-allowed addresses won't be able to claim, implement => `function _isClaimable` as a check inside function `claim`, like this =>

```diff
    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
-      if (claims++ >= limit || claimed[claimTarget]) revert NotClaimable();
+       if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
+       claims++;
        claimed[claimTarget] = true;

        (address[] memory users, bool[] memory allowed) = _makeAllowListPayload(claimTarget);

        allowList.setAllowed(users, allowed);
        return true;
    }
    
-      /// @inheritdoc AIncentive
-      function isClaimable(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external view virtual override returns (bool) {
-      return claims < limit && !claimed[claimTarget] && !allowList.isAllowed(claimTarget, "");
-    }
    

+       /// @inheritdoc AIncentive
+        function isClaimable(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external view virtual override returns (bool) {
+    _isClaimable(claimTarget);
+    }

+       function _isClaimable(address recipient_) internal view returns (bool) {
+       return claims < limit && !claimed[recipient_] && !allowList.isAllowed(recipient_, "");
+    }

```
The `_isClaimable` checks all the edge cases in order to prevent non-allowed addresses from claiming:
```solidity
           function _isClaimable(address recipient_) internal view returns (bool) {
        return claims < limit && !claimed[recipient_] && !allowList.isAllowed(recipient_, "");
    }
```
