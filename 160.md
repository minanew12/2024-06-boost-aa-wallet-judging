# Licensing Compliance Issue Due to Interaction Between MIT and GPL-3.0 Licensed Contracts

## Summary
The project contains smart contracts under mixed licenses: **Points.sol** is licensed under MIT, and **PointsIncentive.sol** is licensed under GPL-3.0. These two contracts directly interact, potentially creating legal obligations due to the strong copyleft nature of GPL-3.0. This audit examines the impact of combining MIT and GPL-3.0 licensed contracts within the project.

## Vulnerability Detail
The key issue is the interaction between two contracts with different licenses. **PointsIncentive.sol** (GPL-3.0) directly interacts with **Points.sol** (MIT), forming a derivative work. The GPL-3.0 imposes strict copyleft requirements, meaning that any software that combines or interacts with GPL-3.0 code must also be licensed under GPL-3.0 when distributed. 

This means that despite **Points.sol** being under the permissive MIT license, the interaction with **PointsIncentive.sol** legally binds the entire combined project to GPL-3.0 requirements. This creates a compliance issue since the project's current licensing structure does not reflect this.

## Impact
Failure to comply with GPL-3.0 obligations may lead to serious legal and operational risks. These risks include:

- **License Violations**: Distributing the project without appropriately licensing the entire work under GPL-3.0 could constitute a breach of the GPL-3.0 license.
- **Loss of Funds or Service Disruption**: If the project is found to be in violation of licensing terms, it could lead to legal action, including demands to cease distribution or modify licensing. This may result in disruptions to protocol operations which could result in loss of funds for the protocol.
  
  **Note**: This is not legal advice. Consultation with a legal expert specializing in open-source software licensing is recommended to fully assess and mitigate the risks.
