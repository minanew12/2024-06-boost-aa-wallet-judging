# Attacker Can Repeatedly Claim Incentives, Leading to Unauthorized Withdrawals from the Protocol

### Summary

Due to incorrect bit manipulation using the XOR operation in the [`SignerValidator::setOrThrow` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L126-L154) , an attacker can reset claimed incentives by toggling bits back to zero. This allows the attacker to repeatedly claim the same incentives, leading to unauthorized withdrawals from the protocol.

### Root Cause

In [SignerValidator.sol#L126-L154](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L126-L154) , within the `setOrThrow` function, the use of the XOR (`xor`) operation to set bits allows claimed incentives to be unset upon repeated calls. Specifically, the function incorrectly toggles bits instead of permanently setting them, compromising the replay protection mechanism.

```solidity
function setOrThrow(IncentiveMap storage bitmap, bytes32 hash, uint256 incentive) internal {
    // ...
    assembly {
        // ...
        let updatedStorageValue := xor(sload(storageSlot), shl(incentive, 1))
        // ...
        let alreadySet := xor(1, shr(incentive, updatedStorageValue))
        if alreadySet {
            // Revert if the incentive has already been claimed
            // ...
        }
        sstore(storageSlot, updatedStorageValue)
    }
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker has a valid `boostId`, `incentiveId`, and can provide valid `claimData` with a legitimate signature.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Initial Claim:**
   - Attacker calls the `validate` function in `SignerValidator.sol` with valid parameters (`boostId`, `incentiveId`, `claimant`, `claimData`).
   - Inside `validate`, the `setOrThrow` function is called, which uses XOR to set the bit corresponding to `incentiveId`, marking it as claimed.

2. **Bit Toggling Issue:**
   - The attacker calls `validate` again with the same parameters.
   - The `setOrThrow` function toggles the bit back to zero due to the XOR operation, effectively unsetting the claimed incentive.
   - The `alreadySet` check fails to detect that the incentive was previously claimed because it relies on the toggled `updatedStorageValue`.

3. **Repeated Claims:**
   - The attacker repeats the process multiple times, each time successfully claiming the same incentive.
   - This results in unauthorized withdrawals from the protocol.


### Impact

The protocol suffers significant financial losses as attackers can repeatedly claim the same incentives without restriction. This leads to unauthorized withdrawals and undermines the trust and integrity of the incentive system. Users and stakeholders may face devaluation of their holdings due to the exploit.

### PoC

Assuming an incentive ID of `0`:

1. **First Claim Attempt:**
   - Attacker calls:
     ```solidity
     signerValidator.validate(boostId, 0, claimant, claimData);
     ```
   - Inside `validate`, `setOrThrow` is invoked.
   - `setOrThrow` computes:
     ```solidity
     let updatedStorageValue := xor(sload(storageSlot), shl(0, 1)); // Toggles bit 0
     ```
   - Since the bit was `0`, it becomes `1`, marking the incentive as claimed.
   - The incentive is successfully claimed.

2. **Second Claim Attempt:**
   - Attacker calls the same `validate` function again:
     ```solidity
     signerValidator.validate(boostId, 0, claimant, claimData);
     ```
   - Inside `setOrThrow`, the bit is toggled again:
     ```solidity
     let updatedStorageValue := xor(sload(storageSlot), shl(0, 1)); // Toggles bit 0 back to 0
     ```
   - The bit is now `0`, effectively unsetting the claimed incentive.
   - The `alreadySet` check fails because it uses the updated (toggled) value:
     ```solidity
     let alreadySet := xor(1, shr(0, updatedStorageValue)); // Evaluates to false
     ```
   - The incentive is incorrectly considered unclaimed, allowing the attacker to claim it again.

3. **Subsequent Claims:**
   - The attacker repeats the process indefinitely, each time toggling the bit and bypassing the replay protection.

**Relevant Code from `setOrThrow`:**

```solidity
assembly {
    // Toggle the bit corresponding to the incentive ID
    let updatedStorageValue := xor(sload(storageSlot), shl(incentive, 1))
    // Check if the bit was already set (ineffective due to toggling)
    let alreadySet := xor(1, shr(incentive, updatedStorageValue))
    if alreadySet {
        // Revert if the incentive has already been claimed
        mstore(0, claimedSelector)
        mstore(4, incentive)
        revert(0x00, 0x24)
    }
    // Store the updated value back to storage
    sstore(storageSlot, updatedStorageValue)
}
```


### Mitigation

Change the Bit Manipulation Logic to Use OR and AND Operations:

- Replace the XOR operation with an OR operation to set bits.
- Use the AND operation to check if a bit is already set.
- This ensures that once a bit is set, it cannot be unset by subsequent calls.
