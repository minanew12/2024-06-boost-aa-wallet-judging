# Malicious Actor Can Block Incentive Claims for Legitimate Users

### Summary

Changing the order of operations in the `setOrThrow` function led to failures in the `alreadySet` check. This issue caused inconsistencies in determining if an incentive bit had been previously claimed, resulting in improper reverts and blocking legitimate incentive claims.


### Root Cause

```solidity
let updatedStorageValue := xor(sload(storageSlot), shl(incentive, 1))
let alreadySet := xor(1, shr(incentive, updatedStorageValue))
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L144C13-L144C16

* The function toggles the bit corresponding to the incentive value by XOR-ing the current storage value with a bitmask created using shl(incentive, 1) to calculate updated value.

* After updating the storage value, the function checks if the bit was already set by shifting and XOR-ing. The `shr(incentive, updatedStorageValue)` operation extracts the bit state, and XOR-ing with 1 determines if the bit was previously set. If the result is non-zero (alreadySet), it indicates that the bit was unset after being toggled.

* One signed message should be able to claim all incentives for a given boost but not any incentive multiple times

Issue : The check logic fails when higher bits are set. Specifically, if a higher bit is set, all lower bits will make the result of `alreadySet` non-zero even when the specific bit of interest is correctly toggled. 



### Impact

A malicious user could exploit this issue by claiming incentives on behalf of another user. By observing and manipulating the incentive bits, the attacker could toggle the bit of the last incentive, preventing the legitimate user from claiming their incentives.

### PoC

run in `SignerValidator.t.sol`

```solidity
    function testIncentiveBitsNormalOrder() public {
        
        _used.setOrThrow(fakeHash, 3);
    
        _used.setOrThrow(fakeHash, 5);

        _used.setOrThrow(fakeHash, 7);

        vm.expectRevert();
        _used.setOrThrow(fakeHash, 5);
    
    }
    // this will revert  cause we claim the 7th first
   // other incentives can't be claimed
    function testIncentiveBitsChangeOrder() public {
        
        _used.setOrThrow(fakeHash, 7);
        
        _used.setOrThrow(fakeHash, 5);

        _used.setOrThrow(fakeHash, 3);

    }
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
    assembly {        
           if gt(incentive, 7) {
                // if the incentive is larger the 7 (the highest bit index)
                // we revert
                mstore(0, invalidSelector)
                mstore(4, incentive)
                revert(0x00, 0x24)
            }
            mstore(0x20, bitmap.slot)
            mstore(0x00, hash)
            let storageSlot := keccak256(0x00, 0x40)
            // toggle the value that was stored inline on stack with xor
            let updatedStorageValue := xor(sload(storageSlot), shl(incentive, 1))
            // isolate the toggled bit and see if it's been unset back to zero
            // here we use and instead of xor, on the original storage
@>      let alreadySet := and(1, shr(incentive, sload(storageSlot)))
            if alreadySet {
                // revert if the stored value was unset
                mstore(0, claimedSelector)
                mstore(4, incentive)
                revert(0x00, 0x24)
            }
            // otherwise store the newly set value
            sstore(storageSlot, updatedStorageValue)
    }
```
