# IncentiveBits.setOrThrow() will revert, leading to a DoS

## Summary
IncentiveBits.setOrThrow() will revert, leading to a DoS.

## Vulnerability Detail
setOrThrow() expects each incentive from 0 to 7 to be used once per hash, reverting in case that for a given hash, an already used incentive is used again. However the mechanism that checks already used incentives does not work as expected: ```alreadySet := xor(1, shr(incentive, updatedStorageValue))```, reverting if incentiveIds are not used in increasing order. 

The external call will come from BoostCore.claimIncentiveFor(), which calls SignedValidator.validate() and therefore setOrThrow(). The value of the incentiveId parameter used is arbitrary and valid as long as ```uint256(validatorData.incentiveQuantity) <= incentiveId``` is not fulfilled, which does not guarantee that calls will necessarily be in increasing order.

Example: Imagine setOrThrow() function is used with incentiveId = 5, in that case updatedStorageValue will be set to XOR (00000000, 00100000) = 00100000. Therefore, the resulting value for alreadySet is:
alreadySet = XOR (1, shr(5, 00100000)) = XOR (00000001, 00000001) = 0 => Does NOT revert.

Now setOrThrow() function is called again for incentiveId = 2, so that updatedStorageValue will be:
XOR (00100000, 00000100) = 00100100. Therefore, the new resulting value for alreadySet is:
alreadySet = XOR (1, shr(2, 00100100)) = XOR (00000001, 00001001) = 00001000 => Reverts as alreadySet != 0

## Impact
Claiming incentive for a given hash will be no longer possible, or fewer claims will be allowed depending on the last incentiveId used. This could be performed by accident by a normal user or on purpose by a malicious attacker to DoS and prevent other users from claiming from this hash.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
For correctly comparing if the incentiveId index has been used, that bit must be totally isolated and XOR it with 1. For this, first shift left until we get 10000000 and then shift 7 times to right to get 1.

```solidity
function setOrThrow(IncentiveMap storage bitmap, bytes32 hash, uint256 incentive) internal {
        bytes4 invalidSelector = BoostError.IncentiveToBig.selector;
        bytes4 claimedSelector = BoostError.IncentiveClaimed.selector;
        /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
        assembly {
            if gt(incentive, 7) {
                // if the incentive is larger the 7 (the highest bit index)
                // we revert
                mstore(0, invalidSelector)
                mstore(4, incentive)
                revert(0x00, 0x24)
            }
            mstore(0x20, bitmap.slot)
            mstore(0x00, hash)
            let storageSlot := keccak256(0x00, 0x40)
            // toggle the value that was stored inline on stack with xor
            let updatedStorageValue := xor(sload(storageSlot), shl(incentive, 1))
            // isolate the toggled bit and see if it's been unset back to zero
-           let alreadySet := xor(1, shr(incentive, updatedStorageValue))
+          let alreadySet := xor(1, shr(7, shl(incentive - 1, updatedStorageValue)))
