# Repeated Incentive Claims Due to Incorrect Bit Manipulation in `setOrThrow` Function

## Summary

An attacker can repeatedly claim incentives due to incorrect bit manipulation in the [`setOrThrow` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L126-L154) , leading to unauthorized withdrawals from the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`setOrThrow` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L126-L154) uses the XOR operation to set bits, which allows claimed incentives to be unset upon repeated calls. This compromises the replay protection mechanism, enabling repeated claims of the same incentives.

## Impact

The protocol suffers financial losses as attackers can repeatedly claim the same incentives without restriction, leading to unauthorized withdrawals and undermining the trust and integrity of the incentive system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace the XOR operation with OR and AND operations to ensure that once a bit is set, it cannot be unset by subsequent calls:

```solidity

function setOrThrow(IncentiveMap storage bitmap, bytes32 hash, uint256 incentive) internal {
    bytes4 invalidSelector = BoostError.IncentiveToBig.selector;
    bytes4 claimedSelector = BoostError.IncentiveClaimed.selector;
    /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
    assembly {
        if gt(incentive, 7) {
            mstore(0, invalidSelector)
            mstore(4, incentive)
            revert(0x00, 0x24)
        }
        mstore(0x20, bitmap.slot)
        mstore(0x00, hash)
        let storageSlot := keccak256(0x00, 0x40)
        let currentStorageValue := sload(storageSlot)
        let bitMask := shl(incentive, 1)
        let alreadySet := and(currentStorageValue, bitMask)
        if alreadySet {
            mstore(0, claimedSelector)
            mstore(4, incentive)
            revert(0x00, 0x24)
        }
        sstore(storageSlot, or(currentStorageValue, bitMask))
    }
}
```
