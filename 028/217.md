# Missing slippage protection for `CGDAIncentive#claim` will cause race condition upon claiming

### Summary

Missing slippage protection for `CGDAIncentive#claim` will cause race condition upon claiming.

### Root Cause

The design of `CGDAIncentive#claim` is the `cgdaParams.currentReward` is decreased by `cgdaParams.rewardDecay` when a user claims

```solidity
    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();
        claims++;

        // Calculate the current reward and update the state
>>      uint256 reward = currentReward();
        cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;
>>      cgdaParams.currentReward =
            reward > cgdaParams.rewardDecay ? reward - cgdaParams.rewardDecay : cgdaParams.rewardDecay;

        // Transfer the reward to the recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
        return true;
    }
```

```solidity
    function currentReward() public view override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - cgdaParams.lastClaimTime;
        uint256 available = asset.balanceOf(address(this));

        // Calculate the current reward based on the time elapsed since the last claim
        // on a linear scale, with `1 * rewardBoost` added for each hour without a claim
        uint256 projectedReward = cgdaParams.currentReward + (timeSinceLastClaim * cgdaParams.rewardBoost) / 3600;
        return projectedReward > available ? available : projectedReward;
    }
```

E.g:
- `cgdaParams.rewardDecay = 100`
- `cgdaParams.rewardBoost = 100`
- `cgdaParams.currentReward = 100`

After 2 hours

Alice claims:
- `currentReward() = 100 + (2 hours * 100) / 3600 = 300`
- `cgdaParams.currentReward = 300 - 100 = 200`
- She claims `300` reward tokens

And then Bob claims:
- `currentReward() = 200 + (0 * 100) / 3600 = 200`
- He claims `200` reward tokens

In this example, since Alice had claimed before Bob, she received more rewards than him.

The problem with this design is both Alice and Bob observe that the current rewards is `300`, so both are claiming expecting the rewards will be `300`. However, it depends on the order of the claim, one will receive the rewards less than the expected amount. This problem occurs due to the fact that the claimant can not specify the slippage, which is the minimum amount of rewards that they want to receive. If the rewards is less than the slippage, then the transaction should revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The boost creator creates a boost with `CGDAIncentive`
- Two users claim rewards close to each other, e.g: the above example

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The example in the root cause.

### Impact

- The user can not claim the expected amount of rewards
- Since there is a restriction in the `SignerValidator` contract that only allow users to claim once per incentive contract [SignerValidator#validate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L70), the user who claimed less than the expected amount, can not claim again in the future

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `CGDAIncentive` contract should have a function to claim with slippage. Note that, the slippage parameter should not be included in the `claimData` that is signed by the validator, because we want to let the user to specify the parameter upon claiming.
