# Potential Identifier Collisions

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

Identifiers for base implementations and clones are derived from user-provided `name_` and other parameters.

There is a risk of collision if the same `name_` is used, especially across different deployers.

## Impact

Legitimate users might be unable to register or deploy clones due to `AlreadyRegistered` errors, caused by name collisions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the identifier generation to include the deployer's address for base implementations.
