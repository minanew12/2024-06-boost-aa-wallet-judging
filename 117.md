# Insufficient Access Control for Boost Owners

## Summary
The BoostCore contract enables the creation of customizable "Boosts" with various components such as budgets, validators, actions, and incentives. However, the contract only permits the contract owner (via the onlyOwner modifier) to modify key parameters or remove Boosts. This can be problematic as individual Boost owners, who may be distinct from the contract owner, do not have the authority to manage or terminate their own Boosts. This setup introduces centralization risks, limiting the control of the actual Boost creators over their own configurations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ability to modify or deactivate a Boost is not implied. This prevents individual Boost owners from managing their own Boosts post-creation, which includes:
 - Modifying Boost parameters such as the budget, validator, action, or incentives.
 - Deactivating or removing their Boost when it's no longer necessary or desired.
Such restrictions could lead to significant inefficiencies in a decentralized environment where individual Boost creators should have autonomy over their creations. Additionally, centralizing all modification and removal powers to a single owner could lead to misuse, delay, or governance issues.
Allowing the Boost owners (i.e., the creators of the Boost) to modify or remove their own Boosts would align better with the decentralized principles and the flexibility of the protocol.

##Impact
While the restrictions of BoostCore does not directly result in a loss of funds or an immediate security vulnerability, it can impact the protocol’s growth and user adoption.
 - Reduced User Autonomy: Boost creators (owners) are unable to modify or remove their Boosts, limiting their ability to manage and update Boost configurations as needed. This restricts flexibility and can lead to frustration for users who expect to have full control over their creations.
 - Reputation and Adoption: A lack of decentralized control can negatively affect user trust in the protocol. Users might be less inclined to participate in or create Boosts if they know they don’t have control over critical aspects of their Boosts.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, we recommend implementing Boost owner-based access control for modification and removal functions.
 - remove
  Instead of deleting the Boost from storage (which would be costly in gas), an active flag can be introduced to mark the Boost as inactive.
```solidity
struct Boost {
    address owner;
    ABudget budget;
    AAction action;
    AValidator validator;
    AAllowList allowList;
    AIncentive[] incentives;
    uint64 protocolFee;
    uint64 referralFee;
    uint256 maxParticipants;
    bool active; // New field to track if the Boost is active
}

// Add `removeBoost` function in BoostCore
function removeBoost(uint256 boostId) external {
    BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId];
    require(boost.owner == msg.sender, "Only the boost owner can remove the boost");
    require(boost.active, "Boost is already inactive");

    boost.active = false; // Mark the Boost as inactive
}
```
 - modify
 This function allows Boost owners to update their Boost’s budget, validator, or other properties while enforcing proper access control.
```solidity
function updateBoostBudget(uint256 boostId, ABudget newBudget) external {
    BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId];
    require(boost.owner == msg.sender, "Only the boost owner can modify the boost");
    require(boost.active, "Cannot modify an inactive boost");

    _checkBudget(newBudget); // Ensure the new budget is valid
    boost.budget = newBudget;
}
```
