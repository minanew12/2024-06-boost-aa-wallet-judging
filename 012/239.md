# Improper Authorization Handling in `createBoost` Function

## Summary

The `createBoost` function in this `BoostCore.sol`  contract is intended to be protected by the `canCreateBoost` modifier, which checks whether the caller (`msg.sender`) is authorized to create a boost. However, a critical flaw arises when the `createBoostAuth` variable is not properly set (i.e., remains `null` or the zero address). In this scenario, an attacker can bypass the authorization check and access the `createBoost` function without being on the whitelist. This creates a potential vulnerability for unauthorized access.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. **Authorized Check in `canCreateBoost` Modifier**: 
   - The `canCreateBoost` modifier is designed to protect the `createBoost` function by ensuring that:
     - The `createBoostAuth` contract is set (`address(createBoostAuth) != address(0)`).
     - The sender (`msg.sender`) is authorized (`createBoostAuth.isAuthorized(sender)`).
   - If the above conditions fail, the function reverts with `BoostError.Unauthorized`.

2. **Attack Scenario 1 (Expected Behavior)**:
   - When `createBoostAuth` is properly initialized and set to a valid contract, unauthorized users who are not whitelisted in the `createBoostAuth.isAuthorized(sender)` function will face a revert error when attempting to access `createBoost`.

3. **Attack Scenario 2 (Critical Flaw)**:
   - If the `createBoostAuth` variable is **unset** (i.e., it is `null` or `address(0)`), the `canCreateBoost` modifierâ€™s condition `address(createBoostAuth) != address(0)` fails.
   - This results in the second part of the check, `!createBoostAuth.isAuthorized(sender)`, being **skipped**.
   - As a result, **any sender**, even if not on the whitelist, can successfully bypass the authorization check and access the `createBoost` function.


## Impact

- In the absence of proper initialization of `createBoostAuth`, unauthorized users can invoke the `createBoost` function, potentially creating boosts without proper permissions. This exposes the system to attacks where unauthorized boosts can be created, violating the integrity of the application.

## Code Snippet:  BoostCore.sol#L76


```solidity
function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
    external
    canCreateBoost(msg.sender)
    nonReentrant
    returns (BoostLib.Boost memory)
{
}

modifier canCreateBoost(address sender) {
    if (address(createBoostAuth) != address(0) && !createBoostAuth.isAuthorized(sender)) {
        revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
    }
    _;
}

function setCreateBoostAuth(address auth_) external onlyOwner {
    createBoostAuth = IAuth(auth_);
}
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. **Enforce `createBoostAuth` Initialization**:
   - Add a check to ensure that the `createBoostAuth` contract is set before allowing any boost creation:
     ```solidity
     require(address(createBoostAuth) != address(0), "Authorization contract not set");
     ```

2. **Improve Modifier Logic**:
   - Modify the `canCreateBoost` to include the `require` statement mentioned above, ensuring that the authorization contract must be initialized before any actions can take place:
     ```solidity
     modifier canCreateBoost(address sender) {
         require(address(createBoostAuth) != address(0), "Authorization contract not set");
         if (!createBoostAuth.isAuthorized(sender)) {
             revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
         }
         _;
     }
     ```
