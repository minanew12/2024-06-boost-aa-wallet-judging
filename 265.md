# BoostCore contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to unbounded loops in the _makeIncentives function

## **Issue: DoS with Block Gas Limit**

**Severity:** Medium

**Issue Type:** Denial of Service (DoS) with Block Gas Limit

---

### **Description**

The `BoostCore` contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to unbounded loops in the `_makeIncentives` function. An attacker can exploit this by providing a maliciously large input to the `createBoost` function, causing the contract to consume excessive gas and ultimately run out of gas (OOG) during execution.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- **`createBoost` Function:**
  - Accepts a `bytes` calldata parameter `data_`, which contains compressed and encoded initialization parameters for creating a new Boost.
  - Decompresses and decodes `data_` into an `InitPayload` struct.
  - Calls `_makeIncentives` with `payload_.incentives`.

- **`_makeIncentives` Function:**
  - Iterates over the `targets_` array (provided by `payload_.incentives`).
  - For each target, performs operations including checking targets and deploying clones.
  - The loop's iteration count is directly controlled by the length of `targets_`.

- **Vulnerability:**
  - An attacker can craft `data_` such that `payload_.incentives` contains an excessively large array.
  - The loop in `_makeIncentives` will process each element, leading to excessive gas consumption.
  - The transaction may run out of gas, causing a DoS condition for the `createBoost` function.

**Vulnerable Functions:**

```solidity
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L266-L291

function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
    internal
    returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
{
    incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
        // Vulnerable unbounded loop
        _checkTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);
        // Additional operations...
    }
}

// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L106-L128

function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
    external
    canCreateBoost(msg.sender)
    nonReentrant
    returns (BoostLib.Boost memory)
{
    InitPayload memory payload_ = abi.decode(data_.cdDecompress(), (InitPayload));

    // Initialize the Boost
    BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts.push();
    // Assign boost properties...

    // Setup the Boost components
    boost.incentives = _makeIncentives(payload_.incentives, payload_.budget);
    // Additional setup...
}
```

### **Impact**

- **Denial of Service:**
  - The `createBoost` function can be rendered unusable if an attacker submits a transaction with a maliciously large `data_`.
  - Legitimate users may experience failed transactions or degraded performance.

- **Resource Exhaustion:**
  - Excessive gas consumption leads to higher transaction fees.
  - Could potentially affect network resources if exploited at scale.

- **Operational Disruption:**
  - May prevent the creation of new boosts, affecting the overall functionality of the protocol.

    address protocolFeeReceiver = address(0x123);

    function setUp() public {

    }
}
```

**Test Output:**

```log
[FAIL. Reason: EvmError: OutOfGas] testCreateBoostWithExcessiveData() (gas: 1073720760)
```

This test demonstrates that when `createBoost` is called with excessively large input data, the transaction fails due to running out of gas.

### **Mitigation**

To address this vulnerability, the contract should implement input validation to limit the size of the input data and the number of incentives processed.

**1. Limit the Number of Incentives**

Introduce a maximum allowable length for the `targets_` array in `_makeIncentives`.

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_INCENTIVES = 100; // Set an appropriate limit

function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
    internal
    returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
{
    require(targets_.length <= MAX_INCENTIVES, "Too many incentives");
    incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
        _checkTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);
        // Continue processing...
    }
}
```

**2. Limit the Input Data Size**

Check the size of the decompressed data in `createBoost` to prevent processing excessively large inputs.

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_DECOMPRESSED_SIZE = 10240; // Example limit (10 KB)

function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
    external
    canCreateBoost(msg.sender)
    nonReentrant
    returns (BoostLib.Boost memory)
{
    bytes memory decompressedData = data_.cdDecompress();
    require(decompressedData.length <= MAX_DECOMPRESSED_SIZE, "Data too large after decompression");

    InitPayload memory payload_ = abi.decode(decompressedData, (InitPayload));
    // Proceed with initialization...
}
```

**3. Early Termination for Invalid Inputs**

Implement sanity checks and fail early if inputs are invalid, reducing unnecessary gas consumption.

---

### **Severity Justification**

- **Impact (Medium):**
  - The vulnerability allows for disruption of the `createBoost` function.
  - Legitimate users may be affected by failed transactions.

- **Likelihood (Medium):**
  - An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting large inputs.
  - The issue arises from user-supplied data without proper validation.

- **Overall Severity: Medium**

---

### **Issue Type**

- **Denial of Service (DoS) with Block Gas Limit**

---

### **Conclusion**

The `BoostCore` contract is susceptible to a Denial of Service attack due to unbounded loops processing user-supplied input in the `_makeIncentives` function. By implementing input validation to limit the size of input data and the number of incentives processed, the contract can prevent excessive gas consumption and mitigate this vulnerability.
