# Front-Running `deployClone` will cause clone deployment to always revert.

## Summary
Attacker can use`deployClone` parameters from mempool to create a contract at that address using create2 to cause clone deployment to always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
`BoostRegistry::deployClone` function calls `cloneAndInitialize` which uses `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(type_, base_, name_, msg.sender))` as the salt which is passed into solady LibClone's `cloneDeterministic` function which uses CREATE2. 

Because of that an attacker can observe the mempool and pick `base_` address as well as the `type_`, `base_`, `name_` and address of the function caller. The attacker can then use those values to deploy a contract at that exact address just before the original `deployClone` tx is executed thus effectively front-running it.

## Impact
Attacker causes `deployClone` to always revert thus causing DoS to the protocol.
