# Predictable Clone Addresses Leading to Front-Running

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deployClone` function uses a deterministic salt based on known parameters:
  ```solidity
  keccak256(abi.encodePacked(type_, base_, name_, msg.sender))
  ```

This makes the address of the cloned contract predictable.

## Impact

**Front-Running Attack**: An attacker can compute the address of the clone and deploy a contract to that address before the legitimate user. This would cause the `cloneAndInitialize` function to fail, resulting in a denial of service for the legitimate user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include a nonce or the current block timestamp in the salt to make it unpredictable.
