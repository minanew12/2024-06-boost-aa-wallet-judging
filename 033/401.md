# Insufficient Validation of Implementations

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `onlyACloneables` modifier only checks if the implementation supports the `ACloneable` interface via `supportsInterface`.

A malicious contract can falsely claim support for `ACloneable` by returning `true` in `supportsInterface`, even if it doesn't correctly implement the interface.

## Impact

Users might unknowingly deploy clones of malicious contracts, leading to potential loss of funds or other security breaches.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement additional checks within `onlyACloneables` to verify that the contract truly implements the expected functions.
