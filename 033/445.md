# Reliance on `supportsInterface` for Security

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract relies on `supportsInterface` for verifying that an implementation is a valid `ACloneable`.

## Impact

Malicious contracts can override `supportsInterface` to return `true`, bypassing the `onlyACloneables` check.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maintain a list of verified contracts rather than relying solely on `supportsInterface`.
