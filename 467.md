# Incorrect Incentive Initialization in BoostCore!

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L266


The line:

```solidity
incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], false));
```

is missing the case where the incentive might be a pre-existing clone rather than a base implementation that needs to be cloned.

The bug is that it's always treating the incentive as if it needs to be cloned (by passing `false` as the third argument to `_makeTarget`), but it should handle both cases:
1. When the incentive is a base implementation that needs to be cloned
2. When the incentive is already a clone that just needs to be used as-is

To fix this, we should check the `isBase` property of the target. Here's the corrected version:

```solidity
incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], targets_[i].isBase));
```

This change ensures that:
- If `targets_[i].isBase` is true, it will clone and initialize the incentive.
- If `targets_[i].isBase` is false, it will use the existing instance without cloning.

This correction aligns with the project's design of allowing both new clones and pre-existing instances to be used as incentives in a Boost.


#### The bug can be triggered because:

1. In the `_makeIncentives` function, there's a check that ensures the target is a base implementation:

```solidity
if (!targets_[i].isBase) {
    revert BoostError.InvalidInstance(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);
}
```

2. However, the subsequent call to `_makeTarget` always passes `false` as the third argument:

```solidity
incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], false));
```

This creates a contradiction: the function requires the target to be a base implementation, but then tells `_makeTarget` not to clone it.

#### Impact and PoC flow:

1. A user attempts to create a new Boost with a custom incentive base implementation.
2. They correctly set `isBase` to true in the `Target` struct for their incentive.
3. The `createBoost` function is called, which in turn calls `_makeIncentives`.
4. `_makeIncentives` passes the validity check for `isBase`.
5. However, when `_makeTarget` is called, it receives `false` as the third argument.
6. Inside `_makeTarget`, the `_maybeClone` function is called:

```solidity
function _maybeClone(BoostLib.Target memory target_, bool shouldInitialize_) internal returns (address instance) {
    instance = target_.isBase ? target_.instance.clone() : target_.instance;
    if (target_.isBase && shouldInitialize_) {
        ACloneable(instance).initialize(target_.parameters);
    }
}
```

7. Because `shouldInitialize_` is false, the cloned instance is never initialized.
8. The uninitialized clone is then used as the incentive for the Boost.

This leads to a serious issue where the incentive contract is deployed but not properly initialized, potentially causing unexpected behavior or failures when interacting with the Boost later.

For example, if the incentive has critical parameters that should be set during initialization (like reward amounts or limits), these would remain unset, possibly leading to funds being locked or the incentive not functioning as intended.
