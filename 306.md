# Clawback targets are not prevented from claiming

## Summary

Targets that receive clawbacks are not marked as claimed, and as such can always go back to call the `claim` function to steal more tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

Using ERC1155Incentive.sol as an example, the `clawback` target can  can receive the claim, and have the claimed event emitted, showing that he has claimed. However it can be noted that the `claimed` mapping is not marked for the target. It also doesn't check that the clawback recipient had initially claimed through the `claim` function. As a result, the target can have the `claim` function called on it and steal receive extra incentives.

```solidity
    function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload));
        (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));

        // Ensure the amount is valid and reduce the max claims accordingly
        if (amount > limit) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));
        limit -= amount;

        // Reclaim the incentive to the intended recipient
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (not a risk here)
        asset.safeTransferFrom(address(this), claim_.target, tokenId, amount, claim_.data);
        emit Claimed(claim_.target, abi.encodePacked(asset, claim_.target, tokenId, amount, claim_.data));

        return true;
    }
```

To prove this, add the following test to ERC1155Incentive.t.sol and run it using `forge test --mt testClawbackClaim -vvvv`. The test should pass.

```solidity
        function testClawbackClaim() public {
        _initialize(mockAsset, AERC1155Incentive.Strategy.POOL, 42, 100);
        assertEq(incentive.limit(), 100);

        bytes memory reclaimPayload = abi.encode(AIncentive.ClawbackPayload({target: address(1), data: abi.encode(50)}));
        incentive.clawback(reclaimPayload);
        assertEq(mockAsset.balanceOf(address(1), 42), 50);

        assertEq(mockAsset.balanceOf(address(incentive), 42), 50);
        assertEq(incentive.limit(), 50);

        incentive.claim(address(1), hex"");
        assertTrue(incentive.claimed(address(1)));
    }
```
Important to note that this is present in all incentive contracts that support clawbacks.
## Impact

Potential double claiming of incentives.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation

Recommend updating the claimed mapping for targets that receive callbacks, to prevent them from claiming extra.
