# Insufficient Handling of Pausable Tokens in the Boost Protocol

## Details

The Boost protocol supports incentive mechanisms using various ERC20 tokens. However, some tokens, like BNB, have a built-in pausing mechanism that can halt token transfers. This feature, while intended for security, can introduce unexpected challenges for the Boost protocol, particularly with budget and incentive contracts that rely on seamless token transfers.

When a pausable token like BNB is paused, all token transfers are frozen, including those initiated by smart contracts. This behavior directly impacts the Boost protocol's functions like allocate, disburse, and claim, which rely on successful ERC20 transfers for core functionality.

## Code Snippets
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L296
```solidity
// ManagedBudget.sol
// ...
function _transferFungible(address asset_, address to_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual nonReentrant {
    // ...
    // Transfer the asset to the recipient
    if (asset_ == address(0)) {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(to_, amount_);
    } else {
        asset_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_); // Potential issue with pausable tokens
    }

    emit Distributed(asset_, to_, amount_);
}
// ...
```

If asset_ is a paused token, the safeTransfer call would fail, and since the function assumes standard ERC20 behavior (revert on failure), it would revert. This prevents the Boost protocol from distributing incentives or processing any other operation involving the paused token.

## Impact

Halted Operations: When a pausable token is paused, any Boost protocol operations involving that token, such as incentive disbursements or budget allocations, would be halted until the token is unpaused.
Inaccessible Funds: Budgets holding paused tokens become temporarily inaccessible, as transferring funds out is not permitted while the token is paused.
Denial of Service: Pausing a token used in a Boost could lead to a denial of service, preventing users from claiming incentives or participating in boosts.

## Scenario

- A user creates a boost offering incentives in a pausable token like BNB.
- The issuer of the pausable token decides to pause the token contract, perhaps due to a security concern or an emergency.
- A user attempts to claim their incentive from the Boost. This triggers the claim function in the corresponding incentive contract, which ultimately calls _transferFungible in ManagedBudget to transfer the tokens.
- The safeTransfer call within _transferFungible fails because the token is paused, causing the entire transaction to revert.
- The user cannot claim their incentive. Additionally, other operations involving the paused token in the Boost protocol, such as budget allocation or clawback, would also be halted.

## Fix

For pausable tokens, consider using an escrow system where tokens intended for incentives or budget allocations are transferred to an escrow contract.

The escrow contract could handle the complexities of interacting with pausable tokens, releasing the funds when the token is unpaused or using a suitable fallback mechanism.
