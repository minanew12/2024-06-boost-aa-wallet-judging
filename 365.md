# Missing `supportsInterface` in `BoostRegistry` Will Cause Integration Failures

### Summary

The `BoostRegistry` contract does not override the `supportsInterface` method from ERC165, which will cause compatibility issues for integrating contracts as additional interfaces are not declared supported.

Sherlock Docs says
> EIP Compliance: For issues related to EIP compliance, the protocol & codebase must show that there are important external integrations that would require strong compliance with the EIP's implemented in the code. The EIP must be in regular use or in the final state for EIP implementation issues to be considered valid


### Root Cause

In `boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostRegistry.sol`, the [`BoostRegistry` contract inherits from `ERC165`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostRegistry.sol#L15) but does not override the `supportsInterface` function to declare support for any additional interfaces beyond ERC165.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Failure to override `supportsInterface` in `BoostRegistry` prevents external contracts from correctly identifying its supported interfaces, potentially leading to integration failures and reduced functionality within the Boost ecosystem.


### PoC

### Mitigation

Override the `supportsInterface` method in the `BoostRegistry` contract to declare support for all intended interfaces.
