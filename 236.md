# No transfer processing for allocate of budget

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L57

In ManageBudget.sol

```Solidity
if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH) {
    FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

    // Ensure the value received is equal to the `payload.amount`
    if (msg.value != payload.amount) {
        revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
    }
}
```

Here is no transfer feature if asset type is ETH.
