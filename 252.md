# The return value of the call is not checked

## Summary
The return value of the call is not checked
## Vulnerability Detail
When using call to transfer money, the return value needs to be checked, but it is not checked in the contract.
## Impact
Transactions will not be reverted due to transfer failures, which would cause the funds to be locked in the contract.
