# Using weird tokens such as rebasing tokens are not supported

### Summary

Consider a rebasing token is used in a boost with one reward claim using ERC20Incentive.

When calling `initialize` the reward is set. 
```solidity
    function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
---------
        reward = init_.reward;
---------
    }
```

However by the time `claim` is called - the token could rebase and there would be insufficient balance to pay for the reward:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L83
```solidity
    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
--------
            asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);
---------
    }
```

Funds would be stuck because the owner can only pull a multiplication of `reward` and not the entire balance 
```solidity
    function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) { 
-----------
            if (amount % reward != 0) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));
-----------
        return true;
    }
```

### Root Cause

`ERC20Incentive` does not support rebasing and other weird tokens

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Weird tokens need to be used as assets to ERC20Incentive

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Use weird token (such as rebasing)
2. Claim reverts.
3. Cannot withdraw all balance.

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing specific incentives for weird tokens and document not to use weird tokens for `ERC20Incentive`.
