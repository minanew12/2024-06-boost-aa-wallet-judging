# Rebasing tokens will be stuck in the ERC20 Incentive on negative rebase

### Summary

Rebasing tokens will be stuck in the ERC20 Incentive on negative rebase

### Root Cause

Protocol intends to work with any type of token including those with weird traits.

> Protocol should work with all native and ERC20 tokens that adhear to standard including weird tokens.
No assumptions are made in regards to the properties of integrating tokens and weird trait tokens should be handled normally. Specifically we'd expect to interact with USDT and other stable coins/decimal 6 coins and erc20z from Zora as well as other fractional NFT contracts as long as they adhere to ERC20 standard. We aren't whitelisting tokens so any erc20 should work (including weird ones).

However, when rebasing tokens is used it can lead to potentially stuck funds.

In the `preflight` function in `ERC20Incentive`, observe that we transfer the `reward`  amount of tokens a raffle strategy and `reward * limit` for a pool strategy.

```solidity
       /// @notice Initialize the contract with the incentive parameters
    /// @param data_ The compressed incentive parameters `(address asset, Strategy strategy, uint256 reward, uint256 limit)`
    function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
        InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));

        if (init_.reward == 0 || init_.limit == 0) revert BoostError.InvalidInitialization();

        // Ensure the maximum reward amount has been allocated
        uint256 maxTotalReward = init_.strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE ? init_.reward * init_.limit : init_.reward;
        uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (available < maxTotalReward) {
            revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, maxTotalReward);
        }

        asset = init_.asset;
        strategy = init_.strategy;
        reward = init_.reward;
        limit = init_.limit;
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    }

    /// @inheritdoc AIncentive
    /// @notice Preflight the incentive to determine the required budget action
    /// @param data_ The {InitPayload} for the incentive
    /// @return budgetData The {Transfer} payload to be passed to the {ABudget} for interpretation
    function preflight(bytes calldata data_) external view override returns (bytes memory budgetData) {
        InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));
        uint256 amount = init_.strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE ? init_.reward * init_.limit : init_.reward;

        return abi.encode(
            ABudget.Transfer({
                assetType: ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
                asset: init_.asset,
                target: address(this),
                data: abi.encode(ABudget.FungiblePayload({amount: amount}))
            })
        );
    }
```
This means that the incentive contract has exactly the amount for everybody to claim.

In the event of a negative rebase, the balance of tokens in the incentive contract will decrease. In pool strategies, this will lead to the last claimer not being able to claim his tokens as we use the saved `reward` amount during `initialize`
```solidity
    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();

        if (strategy == Strategy.POOL) {
            claims++;
            claimed[claimTarget] = true;

            asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, reward);

            emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, reward));
            return true;
        }
```

And for raffle strategies, the balance will be less than the saved `reward` amount which means that attempting to transfer the tokens will revert.
```solidity
    /// @notice Draw a winner from the raffle
    /// @dev Only valid when the strategy is set to `Strategy.RAFFLE`
    function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
        if (strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        // easily influenced by miners on Ethereum
        LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});

        address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];

        asset.safeTransfer(winnerAddress, reward);
        emit Claimed(winnerAddress, abi.encodePacked(asset, winnerAddress, reward));
    }
```
