# push() doesn't return a reference

## Summary

The createBoost function uses an outdated method for adding elements to a storage array and obtaining a reference to the new element. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The line  `BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts.push();`  attempts to add a new element to the _boosts array and obtain a reference to it. However, the  `.push()`  from Solidity 0.6.0 onward, no longer returns a reference. It only appends the new element to the array but does not return a reference to the newly added element. 

In this case, boost variable ends up being a null or invalid reference. This is because push() does not return anything anymore. 

## Impact

Due to the use of `push()`  in the createBoost function of BoostCore contract (using solidity ^0.8.24) , the boost variable will not reference a newly created element as intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the code this way;

_boosts.push();  // Pushes a new empty BoostLib.Boost struct to the array
BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[_boosts.length - 1]; // Retrieves reference to the new struct
