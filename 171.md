# Fee-on-transfer tokens are not being accounted for in ERC20VariableIncentive.

## Summary
In the `claim` function, the code assumes that the full `claimAmount` specified will be received by the `claimTarget`. However, for fee-on-transfer tokens, the actual amount received will be less than the amount sent. This discrepancy is not accounted for, leading to an overestimation of the `totalClaimed` amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
As stated in the README the protocol does expect interact with all weird ERC20s including USDT. 
Looking at the `claim` function, fee-on-transfer tokens are clearly not being accounted for.
function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        BoostClaimData memory boostClaimData = abi.decode(data_, (BoostClaimData));
        uint256 signedAmount = abi.decode(boostClaimData.incentiveData, (uint256));
        uint256 claimAmount;
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();

        if (reward == 0) {
            claimAmount = signedAmount;
        } else {
            // NOTE: this is assuming that the signed scalar is in ETH decimal format
            claimAmount = reward * signedAmount / 1e18;
        }

        if (totalClaimed + claimAmount > limit) revert ClaimFailed();

        totalClaimed += claimAmount; // < @audit
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, claimAmount);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, claimAmount));
        return true;
    }
 ```
 This issue is also prevalent in the `clawback` function.
 ```solidity
 function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload));
        (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));

        limit -= amount;  // < @audit

        // Transfer the tokens back to the intended recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claim_.target, amount);
        emit Claimed(claim_.target, abi.encodePacked(asset, claim_.target, amount));

        return true;
    }
```
As it can be seen in both cases when fee-on-transfer tokens are used the `totalClaimed` and `limit` amounts will be updated incorrectly. 

## Impact
Incorrect values of `limit` and `totalClaimed` cause `_isClaimable` to return incorrect value since it uses  the comparison "`totalClaimed < limit`" thus leading to DoS to the legitimate claimants.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a balance check before and after the transfer. 
Then use the differences in these balances to update the `limit` and `totalClaimed` in their respective functions.
