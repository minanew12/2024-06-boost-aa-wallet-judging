# Signature Malleability Issue in validate Function

## Summary

The validate function in the contract is vulnerable to signature malleability. When a signature is malleable, it means that it is possible to produce another valid signature for the same message

## Vulnerability Detail

The `validate` function relies on the `isValidSignatureNow` method to verify that the provided signature is valid. However, this method does not check if a `signature` is non-malleable. This means that even after a signature has been marked as used, a different but still valid signature for the same message can be generated and used again.

```solidity
/// Validate that the action has been completed successfully by constructing a payload and checking the signature against it
/// @inheritdoc AValidator
function validate(uint256 boostId, uint256 incentiveId, address claimant, bytes calldata claimData)
    external
    override
    returns (bool)
{
    if (msg.sender != _validatorCaller) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

    (BoostClaimData memory claim) = abi.decode(claimData, (BoostClaimData));
    (SignerValidatorInputParams memory validatorData) =
        abi.decode(claim.validatorData, (SignerValidatorInputParams));

    bytes32 hash = hashSignerData(boostId, validatorData.incentiveQuantity, claimant, claim.incentiveData);

    if (uint256(validatorData.incentiveQuantity) <= incentiveId) {
        revert BoostError.InvalidIncentive(validatorData.incentiveQuantity, incentiveId);
    }
    if (!signers[validatorData.signer]) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

    // Mark the incentive as claimed to prevent replays
    // checks internally if the incentive has already been claimed
    _used.setOrThrow(hash, incentiveId); //@check-check for signature related issue here

    // Return the result of the signature check
    // no need for a sig prefix since it's encoded by the EIP712 lib
    return validatorData.signer.isValidSignatureNow(hash, validatorData.signature);
}

```
The function computes a hash of the data and checks if the signature is valid. If valid, the hash is marked as used to prevent replay attacks. However, due to signature malleability, a different valid signature for the same message can bypass this check.



## Impact

When a signature is malleable, it means that it is possible to produce another valid signature for the same message

## Recommendation

* To mitigate this issue, consider verifying that the s value of the signature is within valid bounds to avoid signature malleability.
