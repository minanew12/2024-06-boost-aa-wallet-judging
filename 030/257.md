# Signature in `SignerValidator::validate` is malleable

### Summary

The signature in [`SignerValidator::validate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L50) is malleable because the contract does not check the signature against malleability

### Root Cause

In [`SignerValidator::validate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L50) there is not preventive measure being setup to prevent signature from being manipulated

### Internal pre-conditions

No pre-con

### External pre-conditions

No pre-con

### Attack Path
Because there are no checks to really validate this signature against malleability, attacker can manipulate this signature to create another valid signature to perform operations on behalf of signer.

### Impact

Signature can be manipulated. this means that another valid signature can be produced for the same message and used to perform operations on behalf original signer.

### PoC

From the [`SignerValidator`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L17) we can tell that the contract uses the solady library [SignatureCheckerLib](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/362b2efd20f38aea7252b391e5e016633ff79641/src/utils/SignatureCheckerLib.sol#L24) and from this library we can see that in [line 23](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/362b2efd20f38aea7252b391e5e016633ff79641/src/utils/SignatureCheckerLib.sol#L23) it is stated there is no malleability protection.

However when we head back to our contract, from this [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L50) below

```solidity
    /// Validate that the action has been completed successfully by constructing a payload and checking the signature against it
    /// @inheritdoc AValidator
    function validate(uint256 boostId, uint256 incentiveId, address claimant, bytes calldata claimData)
        external
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        if (msg.sender != _validatorCaller) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        (BoostClaimData memory claim) = abi.decode(claimData, (BoostClaimData));
        (SignerValidatorInputParams memory validatorData) =
            abi.decode(claim.validatorData, (SignerValidatorInputParams));

        bytes32 hash = hashSignerData(boostId, validatorData.incentiveQuantity, claimant, claim.incentiveData);

        if (uint256(validatorData.incentiveQuantity) <= incentiveId) {
            revert BoostError.InvalidIncentive(validatorData.incentiveQuantity, incentiveId);
        }
        if (!signers[validatorData.signer]) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        // Mark the incentive as claimed to prevent replays
        // checks internally if the incentive has already been claimed
        _used.setOrThrow(hash, incentiveId);

        // Return the result of the signature check
        // no need for a sig prefix since it's encoded by the EIP712 lib
        return validatorData.signer.isValidSignatureNow(hash, validatorData.signature);
    }
```

we can see that there is no check to ensure signature is not malleable.

### Mitigation

The 's' value in the signature should be checked to prevent malleability
