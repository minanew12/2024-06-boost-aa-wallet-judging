# The contract action execute function lacks access control

## Summary

The contract action execute function lacks access control

```solidity
    function execute(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool, bytes memory) {
        if (chainId != block.chainid) revert TargetChainUnsupported(chainId);
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = target.call{value: value}(_buildPayload(selector, data_));
        return (success, returnData);
    }
```

Or we can say that the function does not validate the input data even the function selector is set.

consider the case:

the contract action allow user to invoke transfer method.

the admin of action expect alice address to receive the fund.

```solidity
abi.encodeWithSelect(IERC20.transfer.selector, address(alice), 1000);
```

However, the hacker can set bob's address as fund recipient and execute the execute function and transfer the fund out to bob address.

```solidity
abi.encodeWithSelect(IERC20.transfer.selector, address(bob), 1000);
```

Also, the function can be executed repeated without access control while certain action may only expected to be execute once.

## Vulnerability Detail

see above.

## Impact

loss of fund

## Recommendation

add access control in the contract AContractAction.sol execute function using the onlyOwner modifier
