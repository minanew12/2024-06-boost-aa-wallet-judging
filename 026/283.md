# Lack of Data Decoding in `AContractAction.sol::Execute` Function Leads to Multiple Vulnerabilities

## Summary

The execute function in the AcontractAction contract doesnt  decode its input data, leading to a cascade of potential vulnerabilities including function dos

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlockaudit/202406boostaawalletfethallaheth/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/actions/AContractAction.sol#L37

The execute function receives bytes calldata data_ but does not decode it to extract crucial information such as the intended value for the call or the selector. This lack of decoding is the root cause of dos in function;

The execute function begins with a chain ID check that will always revert if the stored chainId doesn't match the current chain's ID:
```solidity
if (chainId != block.chainid) revert TargetChainUnsupported(chainId);
```
This check effectively prevents the function from ever proceeding past this point on any chain that doesn't match the stored chainId, making the rest of the function's logic unreachable.

## Impact

Complete loss of functionality for the execute function on any chain not matching the stored chainId (no chain).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement proper decoding of the input data at the beginning of the execute function:

```solidity
function execute(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool, bytes memory) {
    (uint256 targetChainId, address targetAddress, bytes4 functionSelector, uint256 callValue, bytes memory callData) = abi.decode(data_, (uint256, address, bytes4, uint256, bytes));

    if (targetChainId != block.chainid) revert TargetChainUnsupported(targetChainId);

    require(msg.value == callValue, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");
    require(functionSelector != bytes4(0), "Invalid selector");

    (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = targetAddress.call{value: callValue}(abi.encodePacked(functionSelector, callData));

    require(success, "Call failed");

    return (success, returnData);
}

```
