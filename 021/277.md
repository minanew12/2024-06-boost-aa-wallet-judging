# Potential Role Assignment Mismatch in `ManagedBudget` Initialization

## Summary
The initialize function in the ManagedBudget contract does not verify that the lengths of the authorized and roles arrays match, potentially leading to incorrect role assignments or out-of-bounds access.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-walletfethallaheth/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L43
I
n the initialize function, the contract iterates over the authorized array to assign roles. However, it doesn't check if the authorized and roles arrays have the same length. This oversight can lead to two potential issues:
1. If authorized is longer than roles, it may result in out-of-bounds access when trying to read from roles.
2.If roles is longer than authorized, some role assignments may be skipped, potentially leaving some roles unassigned

## Impact
This vulnerability could lead to incorrect role assignments, potentially granting unauthorized access to certain functions or denying access to authorized users. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public virtual override initializer {
    InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));
    _initializeOwner(init_.owner);
     
    // @audit doesnt check for length mismatch 
    // require(init_.authorized.length , init_.roles.length)
    // this can lead to set a role to untrusted user for a role
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < init_.authorized.length; i++) {
        _setRoles(init_.authorized[i], init_.roles[i]);
    }
}

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, add a length check before the loop to ensure that the authorized and roles arrays have the same length:
```solidity 
function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public virtual override initializer {
    InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));
    _initializeOwner(init_.owner);
     
    require(init_.authorized.length == init_.roles.length, "Array length mismatch");
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < init_.authorized.length; i++) {
        _setRoles(init_.authorized[i], init_.roles[i]);
    }
}

```
