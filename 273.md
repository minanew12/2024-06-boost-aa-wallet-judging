# No Access Control on BoostRegistry::getClones can result in  a DOS

### Summary

From [`BoostRegistry::getClones`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostRegistry.sol#L143) we can see there is a WARNING tag that says the amount data returned is very large and is intended for offchain usage as we know returning large data can cause some sort of DOs depending on how large the data is, since there is no access control to restrict who call this attacker can call this just to grief protocol. 

### Root Cause

NO Access control on [BoostRegistry::getClones](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostRegistry.sol#L143) will be able to make attacker have access to this function to grief protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

no pre-con

### External pre-conditions

no pre-con

### Attack Path

Attacker must call BoostRegistry::getClones

### Impact

An attacker can cause DOS or grief the protocol.

### PoC

from the code below 
```solidity 
    /// @dev WARNING: This function may return a large amount of data and is primarily intended for off-chain usage. It should be avoided in on-chain logic.
    function getClones(address deployer_) external view returns (bytes32[] memory) {
        return _deployedClones[deployer_];
    }
```

we can read from the warning tag that it should be avoided because it returns large data and we all know large data can grief a protocol or cause DOS. When an attacker gets hold of this function he can definitely cause some sort of DOS or grieving attack, because there are no restrictions on the accessibility of the function this will make life easier for the attacker. 

### Mitigation

Restrict access to `BoostRegistry::getClones` by implementing access control
