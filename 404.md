# A referral farmer can take protocol fee share

### Summary

Missing check on the `referrer_` argument of the `claimIncentiveFor` function [here ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L164) allows for a referral farmer to claim the referral fee on all the claims.

### Root Cause

The `referrer_` can be configured to the farmer's address and an incentive can be claimed on their behalf even if the `_referrer` has not actually referred the claimant.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol potentially loses out on fees which are routed to the referral farmer who has not done any work. These fees would normally be taken by the protocol so the protocol is directly missing out on funds that it would have collected in form of protocol fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Maintain a mapping claimants and the respective referrers and make a input validation check on the referrer when an incentive is claimed.
