# Unbounded loop can lead to a dos

## Summary
`ManagedBudget.sol#disburseBatch` contains an unbounded loop which could easily lead to a dos
## Vulnerability Detail
`ManagedBudget.sol#disburseBatch` contains an unbounded loop which could easily lead to a dos 
as the array can be increased by any user and it will affect all other users
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc ABudget
    /// @notice Disburses assets from the budget to multiple recipients
    /// @param data_ The packed array of {Transfer} requests
    /// @return True if all disbursements were successful
    function disburseBatch(bytes[] calldata data_) external virtual override returns (bool) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data_.length; i++) {
            if (!disburse(data_[i])) return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

```
## Impact

## Recommendation
Either make batch txn specific to roles or limit the sizes.
