# Batch Disbursement Atomicity Flaw in `ManagedBudget` Contract

## Summary
The `disburseBatch` function in the `ManagedBudget` contract processes multiple asset disbursements in a single transaction. If any individual disbursement fails, the entire batch transaction is reverted, leading to inefficiencies and potential denial of service.

## Vulnerability Detail
Root Cause: The `disburseBatch` function calls the `disburse` function for each item in the batch. If any call to `disburse` fails, the entire transaction is reverted due to Ethereum's atomic transaction nature.
```solidity
164:     function disburseBatch(bytes[] calldata data_) external virtual override returns (bool) {
165:@=>      for (uint256 i = 0; i < data_.length; i++) {
166:             if (!disburse(data_[i])) return false;
167:         }
---
169:         return true;
170:     }
```
The conditional check `if (!disburse(data_[i])) return false;` in the `disburseBatch` function.

## Impact
- Legitimate batch operations may be disrupted if any single disbursement fails, requiring users to retry the entire batch.
- Users may incur additional gas costs due to repeated attempts to process the entire batch.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism to track the success or failure of each individual disbursement within the batch and handle failures gracefully without reverting the entire transaction.
```diff
function disburseBatch(bytes[] calldata data_) external virtual override returns (bool) {
+   bool allSuccessful = true;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < data_.length; i++) {
-       if (!disburse(data_[i])) return false;
+       if (!disburse(data_[i])) {
+           allSuccessful = false;
            // Log the failure for this specific disbursement
+           emit DisbursementFailed(i, data_[i]);
        }
    }
-   return true;
+   return allSuccessful;
}

  // Event to log failed disbursements
+ event DisbursementFailed(uint256 index, bytes data);
```
