# Unrestricted array length will make sending rewards with `ManagedBudget::disburseBatch` to several addresses fail as the transaction gas will exceed the block gas limit for very long arrays of data.

### Summary

`ManagedBudget::disburseBatch` allow managers or owners to disburse rewards to unlimited number of accounts within a specified array at the same time. The more the number of addresses (or the longer the data array), the more the gas required to complete the transaction. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L165

If the array is long enough the gas required would be greater than 30 million gas, which is the maximum gas limit per block in the Ethereum blockchain. This will cause the transaction to fail and the reward would be temporarily stuck in `ManagedBudget` contract.

### Root Cause

Maximum array length not defined and enforced in `ManagedBudget::disburseBatch`.

### Internal pre-conditions

Sending rewards to multiple addresses at the same time.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Rewards will be temporarily stuck in `ManagedBudget::disburseBatch` contract and gas fees spent on the failed transaction will be lost.

### PoC

30 million gas is the maximum gas limit per block in the Ethereum blockchain according to ethereum.org. Please click the link below.

Please copy the test below into ManagedBudgetTest.t.sol and run it. 

```solidity
    function testAuditDisburseBatch() public {
        uint256 numberOfUsers = 900;
        uint256 amountForEach = 0.0001 ether;
        // Approve the budget to transfer tokens
        uint256 totalAmount = 90 ether;
        mockERC20.approve(address(managedBudget), totalAmount);

        // Allocate the assets to the budget (takes about 6,000 gas)
        managedBudget.allocate(
            _makeFungibleTransfer(
                ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
                address(mockERC20),
                address(this),
                totalAmount
            )
        );

        assertEq(managedBudget.total(address(mockERC20)), totalAmount);

        // Prepare the disbursement requests
        bytes[] memory requests = new bytes[](numberOfUsers);
        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= numberOfUsers; i++) {
            requests[i - 1] = _makeFungibleTransfer(
                ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
                address(mockERC20),
                address(uint160(i)),
                amountForEach
            );
        }

        // Disburse:
        assertTrue(managedBudget.disburseBatch(requests));  // takes over 30 million gas

        // Ensure the budget send the right amount of tokens
        assertEq(
            managedBudget.available(address(mockERC20)),
            (totalAmount - (numberOfUsers * amountForEach))
        );
    }

```

The test will pass with over 31m gas consumed as shown below. By the way, it only takes about 6,000 gas to allocate tokens to the `ManagedBudget` contract. On the mainnet, this transaction will fail as the gas required is greater than maximum gas limit per block (30m).

```


### Mitigation

Set a maximum array length in the function and enforce it. If the data length exceeds the specified maximum, the owner or manager will be prompted to split the transaction into 2 or more.

```diff
+   uint256 public constant MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH = 100;
    function disburseBatch(
        bytes[] calldata data_
    ) external virtual override returns (bool) {
+       if (data_.length > MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH){
+           revert Error(); // split the transaction
+        }
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data_.length; i++) {
            if (!disburse(data_[i])) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
