# ### [H-1]Gas Limit Vulnerability in `disburseBatch` Function

**Description:**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol?plain=1#L164

The `disburseBatch` function in the smart contract is designed to process a batch of disbursement requests. This function loops through an array of requests and calls the `disburse` function for each one. If the number of requests exceeds the block gas limit, the transaction will fail due to insufficient gas.

```javascript
// @audit gas limit?
    function disburseBatch(
        bytes[] calldata data_
    ) external virtual override returns (bool) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data_.length; i++) {
            if (!disburse(data_[i])) return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
```

**Impact:**

When the number of disbursement requests in a batch exceeds the gas limit of the Ethereum block, the entire transaction will fail. This failure prevents any of the disbursement operations from being processed, potentially causing financial loss or service disruption. The inability to process a large batch of transactions can affect the contractâ€™s usability and reliability.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**

Place the following test into `ManagedBudget.t.sol`.

```javascript
function test_DisburseBatch() public {
   /**
 // Approve the budget to transfer tokens
    mockERC20.approve(address(managedBudget), 50 ether);
    mockERC1155.setApprovalForAll(address(managedBudget), true);

    // Allocate the assets to the budget
    managedBudget.allocate(
        _makeFungibleTransfer(ABudget.AssetType.ERC20, address(mockERC20), address(this), 50 ether)
    );
    managedBudget.allocate{value: 25 ether}(
        _makeFungibleTransfer(ABudget.AssetType.ETH, address(0), address(this), 25 ether)
    );
    managedBudget.allocate(_makeERC1155Transfer(address(mockERC1155), address(this), 42, 50, bytes("")));
    assertEq(managedBudget.total(address(mockERC20)), 50 ether);
    assertEq(managedBudget.total(address(0)), 25 ether);
    assertEq(managedBudget.total(address(mockERC1155), 42), 50);
*/

    // Prepare a large batch of disbursement requests
    uint256 batchSize = 1000; // Example large batch size
    bytes[] memory requests = new bytes[](batchSize);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < batchSize; i++) {
        if (i % 3 == 0) {
            requests[i] = _makeFungibleTransfer(ABudget.AssetType.ERC20, address(mockERC20), address(i + 1), 1 ether);
        } else if (i % 3 == 1) {
            requests[i] = _makeFungibleTransfer(ABudget.AssetType.ETH, address(0), address(i + 1), 1 ether);
        } else {
            requests[i] = _makeERC1155Transfer(address(mockERC1155), address(i + 1), 42, 1, bytes(""));
        }
    }

    // Disburse the large batch
    try managedBudget.disburseBatch(requests) {
        // If successful, this will not run due to gas limit issue
        assertTrue(false, "Expected transaction to fail due to gas limit");
    } catch {
        // Expected to catch an error due to gas limit
        assertTrue(true, "Transaction failed as expected due to gas limit");
    }
}

```

**Recommended Mitigation:**

Implement a maximum batch size limit in the `disburseBatch` function to ensure that the number of requests does not exceed the gas limit of a block. This prevents the function from processing too many requests in a single transaction.
