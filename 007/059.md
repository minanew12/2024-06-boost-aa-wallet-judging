# Transactions calling `ManagedBudget::disburseBatch` will fail if one of the transfers to each specified addresses reverts leading to rewards being temporarily stuck (DoS).

### Summary

`ManagedBudget::disburseBatch` is for transfering rewards to multiple addresses at the same time. If one of the transfers fail or reverts for any reason, the whole transaction fails and the gas consumed so far is lost. The rewards will be stuck until the owner or manager is able to identify and isolate the address with an issue. 

### Root Cause

Including an address with any unknown issue, e.g a contract address that cannot receive ether or is not ERC1155 receiver, among the reward beneficiaries. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The rewards will be stuck until the owner or manager is able to identify and isolate the address with an issue and the gas fees for the failed transaction would be lost. 

### PoC

Please copy the test below into ManagedBudgetTest.t.sol and run it. 

```solidity

    function testAuditDisburseBatchReverts() public {
        uint256 numberOfUsers = 10;
        uint256 amountForEach = 1 ether;
        // Approve the budget to transfer tokens
        uint256 totalAmount = 90 ether;
        mockERC20.approve(address(managedBudget), totalAmount);

        // Allocate the assets to the budget
        managedBudget.allocate(
            _makeFungibleTransfer(
                ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
                address(mockERC20),
                address(this),
                totalAmount
            )
        );
        assertEq(managedBudget.total(address(mockERC20)), totalAmount);
        // Prepare the disbursement requests
        bytes[] memory requests = new bytes[](numberOfUsers);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < numberOfUsers - 1; i++) {
            requests[i] = _makeFungibleTransfer(
                ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
                address(mockERC20),
                address(uint160(i)),
                amountForEach
            );
        }
        // Adding an invalid address at the end of the array
        requests[numberOfUsers - 1] = _makeFungibleTransfer(
            ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
            address(mockERC20),
            address(uint160(0)),
            amountForEach
        );
        // Disburse: failed
        vm.expectRevert();
        managedBudget.disburseBatch(requests);
    }

```

### Mitigation

Refactor `ManagedBudget::_transferFungible` 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L296
and `ManagedBudget::_transferERC1155` 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L315
to use try-and-catch block as shown below.

        if (amount_ > available(asset_)) {
            revert InsufficientFunds(asset_, available(asset_), amount_);
        }

        _distributedFungible[asset_] += amount_;

        // Transfer the asset to the recipient
        if (asset_ == address(0)) {

        }

        emit Distributed(asset_, to_, amount_);
    }

        _distributedERC1155[asset_][tokenId_] += amount_;

        // Transfer the asset to the recipient
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (`nonReentrant` modifier is applied to the function)
        try IERC1155(asset_).safeTransferFrom(address(this), to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_) {} catch { 
            // save the address  with failed transfer and continue to the next iteration
