# Inconsistent Name Uniqueness Check in deployClone and register

### Summary

The `BoostRegistry` contract's `deployClone` function ensures that the clone's identifier is unique. However, it does not enforce the uniqueness of the `name_` parameter across different bases or deployers. In contrast, the register function does check for uniqueness of the `name_` within a given `type_`, which can cause inconsistencies. Specifically, multiple users can deploy clones with the same `type_` and `name_` but different `base_` or `msg.sender` values, leading to potential conflicts when registering implementations.

### Root Cause

The deployClone function checks the uniqueness of the identifier, which includes type_, base_, msg.sender, and name_, but does not enforce the uniqueness of name_ within the function scope.

```solidity
        bytes32 identifier = getCloneIdentifier(type_, base_, msg.sender, name_);
        if (address(_clones[identifier].instance) != address(0)) revert AlreadyRegistered(type_, identifier);

```

Meanwhile, the register function ensures name_ is unique within its type_, causing a discrepancy in how names are handled.

```solidity
        bytes32 identifier = getIdentifier(type_, name_);

        if (address(_bases[identifier]) != address(0)) revert AlreadyRegistered(type_, identifier);

```

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Two different users attempt to deploy clones with the same type_ and name_ but different base_ or msg.sender values.
2. The deployClone function allows both deployments without ensuring name_ uniqueness.
3. When trying to register, the second userâ€™s attempt reverts due to the name_ already being registered within the same type_.

### Impact

1. Causes naming conflicts and potential confusion when multiple clones with the same type_ and name_ but different base_ or msg.sender values are deployed.
2. Users may experience unexpected reverts during registration due to name conflicts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To ensure consistency and prevent naming conflicts, the deployClone function should also enforce the uniqueness of name_ within the same type_. Update the deployClone function to include a check for name_ uniqueness similar to the register function.
