# Wrong route Claim Fee

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L318

in _routeClaimFee function

function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
        protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
    }

in code "protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance); ",  sends all ETH to protocolFeeReceiver.

There can have multiple boosts. 
But if send all ETH for 1 boost, there will no balance when call claimIncentive for 2nd boosts.




## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Need to use 

protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);

instead of

protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);

2. The BoostCore contract didn't use protocolFee variable.
 So can calculate by protocolFee
