# Fee on transfer tokens break some of the contracts

## Summary

According to the README file, weird ERC20 tokens are supported by the protocol. The problem is that in many places in the code, the use of fee-on-transfer tokens leads to a revert on identical checks, which verify whether the received and sent amounts of tokens match. As a result, these contracts cannot be initialized and thus cannot be used.

## Vulnerability Detail

The first contract where this occurs is the CGDAIncentive contract, in the initialize function. 

```solidity
InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));


uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
if (available < init_.totalBudget) {
    revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, init_.totalBudget);
}
```

There, it is checked whether the actual balance of the respective token is less than what is declared in totalBudget, and if it is, the contract reverts. The initialize function is executed when creating a boost in the BoostCore.sol contract. It is important to note that when submitting incentive contracts for the respective boost, it is mandatory that they are cloned from the base contract and then initialized. It is not allowed to submit an already initialized and ready-to-use incentive contract. During this process, the preflight function is called, which returns the required amount of tokens that need to be transferred from the respective budget to the corresponding incentive contract, and only after that, the initialize function of the incentive contract is called. The preflight function returns the same value init_.totalBudget, which is used in the initialize function during the aforementioned check. This means that when a fee-on-transfer is applied, the received amount of tokens will be less than expected, and the function will revert.

```solidity
bytes memory preflight = incentives[i].preflight(targets_[i].parameters);
if (preflight.length != 0) {
    // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
    assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
}
```

I will list a few more places in other contracts where the same check occurs without describing them in detail. I am grouping them together because the check is the same, and the fix will be the same, even though they are in different functions.

ERC20Incentive.initialize:

```solidity
  uint256 maxTotalReward = init_.strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE ? init_.reward * init_.limit : init_.reward;
  uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
  if (available < maxTotalReward) {
      revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, maxTotalReward);
  }
```

ManagedBudget.allocate() : 

```solidity
request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
    revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
}
```

## Impact

Inability to initialize core contracts and hence broken core contract functionality.

## Recommendation

Give up supporting fee-on-transfer tokens or adjust these functions to work with fee-on-transfer tokens.
