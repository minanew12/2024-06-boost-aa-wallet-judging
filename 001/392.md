# Incorrect Balance Check in `ERC20` Allocation Logic

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `allocate` function in the `ManagedBudget.sol` contract contains a logic bug in the handling of `ERC20` token transfers. Specifically, the function does not correctly verify that the `exact` amount of tokens specified in the allocation request has been transferred to the contract. This can lead to incorrect state updates and potential exploitation.

```solidity

        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        }
```
```solidity
 function allocate(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool) {
        Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
        if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Ensure the value received is equal to the `payload.amount`
            if (msg.value != payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
            ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of `payload.tokenId` to this contract
            IERC1155(request.asset).safeTransferFrom(
                request.target, address(this), payload.tokenId, payload.amount, payload.data
            );
            if (IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else {
            // Unsupported asset type
            return false;
        } 
```

The current implementation transfers `payload.amount` of the ERC20 token from `request.target` to the contract using `safeTransferFrom`. After the transfer, it checks if the balance of the contract is less than `payload.amount`. If it is, it reverts with `InvalidAllocation`.

The issue here is that the contract does not check the balance of the token before the transfer. This means that if the contract `already holds` some amount of the token, the balance check after the transfer might not accurately reflect whether the transfer was successful.

Consider the following scenario to illustrate the issue:

1. The contract currently holds 50 tokens of a specific ERC20 token.
2. An allocation request is made to transfer 30 tokens to the contract.
3. The `safeTransferFrom`  transfers fewer tokens than expected (like fee on transfer tokens)(e.g., 10 tokens).
4. After the transfer, the contract's balance is 60 tokens.
5. The balance check `if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount)` passes because 60 is not less than 30.
6. The function does not revert, and the state is incorrectly updated to reflect that 30 tokens were allocated, even though only 10 tokens were actually transferred.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

* The balance of the contract should be checked before and after the transfer, and the difference should be verified to ensure that the exact amount has been transferred
