# Lack of Explicit Approval Checks for ERC20 and ERC1155 Token Transfers in ManagedBudget's Allocate Function

## Summary


The allocate function in the ManagedBudget contract performs ERC20 and ERC1155 token transfers without explicitly checking for or handling token approvals leading to failed transactions for both token types.


## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-walletfethallaheth/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L57
In the allocate function, when handling both ERC20 and ERC1155 token transfers, the contract uses safeTransferFrom to move tokens from the sender to the contract. However, it doesn't verify if the contract has been approved to spend the sender's tokens before attempting the transfer for either token type.

## Impact

This oversight can result in failed transactions if users haven't approved the contract to spend their tokens beforehand. It may lead to a poor user experience and potential confusion for users interacting with the contract, affecting both ERC20 and ERC1155 token allocations.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add explicit approval checks before the transfers:
