# `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` can be Dosed by any of the first Recipients before the `protocolFeeReceiver` during a claim leading to a loss of funds

## Summary
 The claim process of the claim fee in `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` might be Dosed by either a malicious boost owner or referrer, breaking the protocol's core functionality. This would also result in fee loss for the protocol as protocol fees won't be collected.

## Vulnerability Detail
 In `BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor` when claiming an incentive, the `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` is called to distribute claimFees among all recipients.

 ```Solidity
       function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee)
            revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(
                address(0),
                msg.value,
                claimFee
            );
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);
 ```

 The claimFee is supposed to be distributed to one or more of the following individuals:
 - Referrer (if any)
 - boost owner
 - Protocol fee receiver

 ```Solidity
            if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = (claimFee * boost.referralFee) /
                FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
        protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
 ```

 The risk is the way amount is distributed where as long as any of the first two recipients (referrer or boost owner) maliciously reverts upon receiving the Eth, they could DOS all the other recipients. 

## Impact
 When a fee recipient decides to maliciously revert, all the other recipients will loss their share of the fee as they won't receive their share.

## Recommendation
 Consider using a pull method for recipients to claim their share instead of transferring the fee directly to them during claiming in the `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` .
