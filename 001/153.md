# BoostCore.sol: createBoost does not check the maximum referralFee

### Summary

The function [BoostCore.sol::createBoost](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L106-L144) allows a user to create a new boost. The user can set a `referralFee` as part of the `payload_` to specify the `boost.referralFee` of that boost. As there is no limit check for this setting, a creator can set a arbitrary high fee.

### Root Cause

Missing check for a maximum `referralFee`.
