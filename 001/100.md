# ManagedBudget can be permissionlessly drained of ~95% fee-on-transfer tokens held by it

## Summary
***Please assume that the fee-on-transfer tokens will be directly transferred (top-up'ed) by the boost owners or mantainers. The balance may also be a result of a donation.***

The protocol's README explicitly states that fee-on-transfer tokens and their behaviour (just like any other weird ERC20 tokens) are in-scope:
> Protocol should work with all native and ERC20 tokens that adhear to standard including weird tokens.
No assumptions are made in regards to the properties of integrating tokens and weird trait tokens should be handled normally. Specifically we'd expect to interact with USDT and other stable coins/decimal 6 coins and erc20z from Zora as well as other fractional NFT contracts as long as they adhere to ERC20 standard. We aren't whitelisting tokens so any erc20 should work (including weird ones).

**After confirmation with the sponsor:**

> fee-on-trasfer tokens are not explicitly supported *but they also shouldn't lead to loss of funds if they are used on accident.*

And the sponsor also clarified further:
> Q: So if fee-on-transfer asset is transferred to ManagedBudget, it shouldn't be possible for anyone malicious to drain it from there, right? (wondering because fee-on-transfer may be a donation from someone to the ManagedBudget.)
> **A: If there’s a vector here that’s worth knowing!**

The `ManagedBudget`'s `allocate` function can be utilized to consume ~95% of funds held by the contract, leaving only a small portion remaining.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is possible for 2 reasons:
1. `allocate` is unpermissioned and can be called by anyone;
2. The `request.target` is not validated to be the `msg.sender` AND most importantly --- it's not validated to be an address DISTINCT from the `address(this)`.

## Impact
An attacker can spend some gas (which is pretty cheap on L2s, note: all EVM-compatible L2 are stated to be in-scope based on
> **On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?** EVM-compatible networks (excluding zkSync Era and other where CREATE2 operates abnormally).
) and be able to consume almost 95% of the balance held by `ManagedBudget` by continuously calling `allocate` with `request.target` as **the address of the `ManagedBudget` contract itself**.

Only dust will be left, because dust is important for the `request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount` to pass without reverting.

        if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Ensure the value received is equal to the `payload.amount`
            if (msg.value != payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount); // THE PROBLEM IS HERE
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
            ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of `payload.tokenId` to this contract
            IERC1155(request.asset).safeTransferFrom(
                request.target, address(this), payload.tokenId, payload.amount, payload.data
            );
            if (IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else {
            // Unsupported asset type
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual review.

## Recommendation
I believe the main problem here is the lack of `request.target != address(this)` check in particular, so consider implementing it here:
```diff
    /// @inheritdoc ABudget
    /// @notice Allocates assets to the budget
    /// @param data_ The packed data for the {Transfer} request
    /// @return True if the allocation was successful
    /// @dev The caller must have already approved the contract to transfer the asset
    /// @dev If the asset transfer fails, the allocation will revert
    function allocate(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool) {
        Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
        if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Ensure the value received is equal to the `payload.amount`
            if (msg.value != payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
+           require(request.target != address(this), "Cannot transfer from itself");
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
            ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of `payload.tokenId` to this contract
            IERC1155(request.asset).safeTransferFrom(
                request.target, address(this), payload.tokenId, payload.amount, payload.data
            );
            if (IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else {
            // Unsupported asset type
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
```


## Please note
That the
```solidity
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
```
check will not prevent the attack, because the payload.amount can be specified as partial chunks, and because the receiver is always the `address(this)` in this attack vector, and the `balanceOf` is checked **AFTER** the transfer has been completed.

### For instance:

The `ManagedBudget` contract currently holds 20,000e18 tokens.

The fee charged with every call is 5% of the amount of the transfer.

An attacker calls `allocate` continuously with the `request.target` as the `address(managedBudget)` and the `payload.amount` as `10,000e18`.

Each time the `allocate` function is called by the attacker, `500e18` tokens are lost.

#### `20,000e18 - 500e18` is obviously more than `10,000e18`.

Then `20,000 - 500e18` = `19,500e18` tokens are left in the `ManagedBudget` contract.

We can "transfer" `10,000e18` tokens back and forth, and consume `500e18` tokens again.

Then `19,500e18 - 500e18` tokens are left.

**This can be repeated continuously in order to drain 50% of the `ManagedBudget`'s funds.**

***Then, when only `10,500e18` tokens are left in the `ManagedBudget` contract, the attacker can repeat the same process with `5,000e18` tokens as the `payload.amount`.***

Now each time the `allocate` function is maliciously called, `250e18` tokens will be drained ("consumed") every single time.

This can be repeated until `5,250e18` tokens are left in the `ManagedBudget` contract.

And then the process can be repeated so on and so on.
