# Reentrancy Vulnerability

## Summary

The _transferFungible and _transferERC1155 functions use the nonReentrant modifier, which is good, but care should be taken to ensure that all external calls (like transfers) are made before state updates.

## Impact

The _transferFungible and _transferERC1155 functions utilize the nonReentrant modifier, which helps protect against reentrancy attacks. However, the order of operations within these functions is crucial. If external calls, such as token transfers, occur after state updates, it can lead to significant vulnerabilities.

Reentrancy Attacks: If state changes are made before external calls, an attacker could exploit the contract by calling the function again during the execution of the external call. This could allow them to manipulate the contract's state in their favor, potentially draining funds or altering balances.

State Inconsistency: Making state updates before external transfers can result in inconsistencies. If a transfer fails after the state has been updated, the contract may reflect an inaccurate state, leading to confusion and potential loss of funds.

User Trust and Experience: Users expect that their transactions will be processed accurately and securely. If a vulnerability is exploited due to improper ordering of operations, it could damage user trust and lead to a loss of confidence in the contract.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L296

```solidity
 function _transferFungible(address asset_, address to_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual nonReentrant {
    // Increment the total amount of the asset distributed from the budget
    if (to_ == address(0)) revert TransferFailed(asset_, to_, amount_);
    if (amount_ > available(asset_)) {
        revert InsufficientFunds(asset_, available(asset_), amount_);
    }

    _distributedFungible[asset_] += amount_;

    // Transfer the asset to the recipient
    if (asset_ == address(0)) {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(to_, amount_);
    } else {
        asset_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_);
    }

    emit Distributed(asset_, to_, amount_);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

By transferring the asset before updating the state, we mitigate potential reentrancy attacks.

```solidity
function _transferFungible(address asset_, address to_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual nonReentrant {
    if (to_ == address(0)) revert TransferFailed(asset_, to_, amount_);
    if (amount_ > available(asset_)) {
        revert InsufficientFunds(asset_, available(asset_), amount_);
    }

    // Transfer the asset to the recipient
    if (asset_ == address(0)) {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(to_, amount_);
    } else {
        asset_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_);
    }

    // Increment the total amount of the asset distributed from the budget
    _distributedFungible[asset_] += amount_;
    emit Distributed(asset_, to_, amount_);
}
