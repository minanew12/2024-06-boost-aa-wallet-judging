# An attacker can front-run transactions calling `ManagedBudget::allocate` to ensure the transactions revert eventhough tokens may have been transferred to the `ManagedBudget` contract

### Summary

An attacker can easily cause denial of service to users of `ManagedBudget` contract by constantly front-running every transaction calling `ManagedBudget::allocate` due to the fact that `ManagedBudget::allocate` implements safeTransferFrom function with user-specified 'from' address instead of msg.sender.

### Root Cause

safeTransferFrom function signature for ERC20 is      
```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(IERC20 token, address from, address to, uint256 value) internal {}
```
safeTransferFrom function signature for ERC1155 is 

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external;
```
User specified `from` address (request.target) is used instead of `msg.sender` in `ManagedBudget::allocate` as shown below;

### Attack Path

1. A user approves ERC20 or ERC1155 tokens for ManagedBudget contract to spend;
2. the user prepares input data and send the transaction to the blockchain. This transaction is kept in the mempool first;
3. an attacker sees this transaction and prepares another transaction depositing tokens from the same user but with higher gas;
4. the attacker's transaction will probably be mined first due to higher gas limit, executing the deposit ahead of the user.
5. When the user's transaction finally get mined, his transaction will revert as the allowance amount approved for the contract has already been spent by the attacker.
6. The user's tokens will be deposited into the `ManagedBudget` contract without the user's knowledge.

### Impact

Denial of service (DoS) to users.

### Mitigation

Refactor the `ManagedBudget::allocate` as shown below;

```diff
function allocate(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool) {
        Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
        if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Ensure the value received is equal to the `payload.amount`
            if (msg.value != payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));
            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
-           request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
+           request.asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), payload.amount);
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
            ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));
            // Transfer `payload.amount` of `payload.tokenId` to this contract
-           IERC1155(request.asset).safeTransferFrom(
-               request.target, address(this), payload.tokenId, payload.amount, payload.data
-           );
+           IERC1155(request.asset).safeTransferFrom(
+               msg.sender, address(this), payload.tokenId, payload.amount, payload.data
+           );
            if (IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else {
            // Unsupported asset type
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
