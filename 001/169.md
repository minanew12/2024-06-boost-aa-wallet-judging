# Allocation Of Budget Would Be Incorrect Under A Certain Edge Case

## Summary

Boost supports all kinds of token including fee on transfer tokens , but while allocating funds to the budget contract if the token is a fee on transfer token then the allocation would revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) A budget contract is created which would be used to allocate assets for boosts.

2. ) The owner of the budget now wants to allocate some funds to this budget and the asset token being allocated is a ERC20 fee on transfer token

3.) But the allocation would fail here -->

since balance of this token in the contract would be indeed lesser than the amount specified to be transferred (some fee deducted while transferring)

4.) Therefore the whole budgeting logic is incompatible with fee on transfer tokens which is clearly specified to be allowed by the devs.

## Impact

Allocation of budget would fail if the token is a fee on transfer token or if the token upgrades and starts charging a fee on transfer.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Compare via balance before transfer and after transfer
