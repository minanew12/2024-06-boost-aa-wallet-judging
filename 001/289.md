# ManagedBudget::allocate does not support fee on transfer tokens

### Summary

The check in [ManagedBudget](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L71-L73) will cause allocate to revert whenever Fee-on-transfer tokensis used 

### Root Cause

[This check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L71-L73) does not support the use of Fee-on-transfer tokens 

### Internal pre-conditions

allocate needs to be called with fee-on-transfer tokens for example usdt

### External pre-conditions

Token used has to be FOT

### Attack Path

Call `ManagedBudget::allocate` with fee on transfer with correct data and params.

### Impact

Allocate will always revert whenever fee-on-transfer tokens are used even though protocol supports it as stated.


### PoC

From the contest page we can find that the protocol accepts fee-on-transfer and is ready to work with it 
```solidity
Protocol should work with all native and ERC20 tokens that adhear to standard including weird tokens. No assumptions are made in regards to the properties of integrating tokens and weird trait tokens should be handled normally. Specifically we'd expect to interact with USDT and other stable coins/decimal 6 coins and erc20z from Zora as well as other fractional NFT contracts as long as they adhere to ERC20 standard. We aren't whitelisting tokens so any erc20 should work (including weird ones)
```
taking into consideration what they said, we can see from the implementation of `allocate` 

```solidity
function allocate(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool) {
        Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
...
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            //@audit
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        ...

    }
```

the function will revert anytime FOT is used because the amount received is always less than the amount sent because of fees.

### Mitigation

Implement a better check that takes into consideration fee-on-transfer tokens
