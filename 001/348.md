# The boost's owner can steal the protocol's profit using referralFee = 100%.

## Summary

When creating a boost, the user has the right to set payload_.referralFee, which is added to the referral fee set by the protocol administrator and applied if a referrer_ parameter is provided during a claim from the new boost. The problem is that there is a total claim fee that is charged and divided between the referrer, protocol, and boost owner. By setting an large referralFee, the boost owner can claim the entire claim fee for themselves, depriving the protocol of profit.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
  uint256 netFee = claimFee;


  // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
  if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
      uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
      netFee -= referralShare;
      referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
  }


  // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
  boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
  protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
```

In the _routeClaimFee function, it can be seen that first, boost.referralFee is deducted, and the remainder is split between boost.owner and protocolFeeReceiver. If boost.referralFee is set to 100%, the amount left for boost.owner and protocolFeeReceiver will be zero. The boost owner can set boost.referralFee to 100% and arrange for the users claiming incentives to always send an address controlled by them as the referrer. In this way, they can effectively capture the entire claim fee.

## Impact

Loss of funds for the protocol
