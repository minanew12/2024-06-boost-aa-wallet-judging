# Incorrect fee calculation logic in boost claim function

## Summary
The fee calculation for claiming a boost does not properly account for the `protocolFee` variables. Additionally, the system can be manipulated to send zero fees to the Boost Protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_routeClaimFee` function splits the claimFee into several parts:
- referralFee
- netFee (split equally between the boost owner and the protocol)

However, the Boost owner can set the referral fee to 100% without any restriction. This allows a user claiming the boost to input their own address as the `referrer_` and claim the entire `claimFee`.

As a result, the remaining fee sent to the owner and protocol is effectively zero, so no fee is transferred.
## Impact

Boost owners can exploit this logic to prevent the Boost Protocol from earning any fees.

## Recommendation

Deduct the `protocolFee` first before calculating the referral fee. Additionally, implement limits on the maximum allowable referral fee.
