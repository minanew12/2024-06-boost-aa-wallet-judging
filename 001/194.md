# Protocol fee is not enforced in Boostcore

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `BoostCore` contract the `protocolFee` is set as a base of `1_000` (10%) and is set on each boost as `boost.protocolFee` but this fee is not enforced anywhere throughout the protocol. It can be seen that only the `boost.referralFee` is enforced in the `_routeClaimFee` function which is called when users claim the incentives. But the `boost.protocolFee` is not enforced which causes the protocol to lose potential revenue.

## Impact
Loss of protocol revenue.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce the protocol fee depending on the protocol economic model for example this could be when a user creates a boost or during claiming incentive.
