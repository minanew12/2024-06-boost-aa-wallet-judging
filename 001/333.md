# Improper claim fee routing mechanism

### Summary

In the `BoostCore._routeClaimFee()` function, the claim fee is equally divided between the protocol fee receiver and the boost owner, even though the `boost.protocolFee` has already been set.

### Root Cause

As noted in [BoostCore.sol:121](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet-davies0212/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L121), `boost.protocolFee` is set when the boost is created, representing the portion of the claim fee allocated to the protocol fee receiver.

```solidity
    function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
        ...

121     boost.protocolFee = protocolFee + payload_.protocolFee;
        ...
```

However, as indicated in [BoostCore.sol:317-318](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet-davies0212/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L317-L318), half of the fee is sent to the boost owner, while the remaining half is sent to the protocol fee receiver, regardless of the value of `boost.protocolFee`.

```solidity
    function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
317     boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
318     protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Can fix as follows.

```diff
    function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
-       boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
-       protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
+       protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(netFee * boost.protocolFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR);
+       boost.owner.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
    }
```
