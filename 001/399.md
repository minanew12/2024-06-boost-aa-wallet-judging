# Lack of Support for Fee on Transfer, Rebasing, and Tokens with Balance Modifications Outside of Transfers in ManagedBudget.sol

## Summary

duplicate of https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea-judging/issues/545

The `ManagedBudget.sol` contract aims to handle various asset types, including ERC20 tokens. However, it lacks the necessary support for tokens that:

1. Charge a fee on transfer.
2. Rebase (adjust their total supply dynamically).
3. Modify balances outside of standard transfer operations.

This oversight can lead to significant accounting issues and potential loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `allocate` function in `ManagedBudget.sol` handles the allocation of assets to the budget. However, it does not properly account for the actual amount transferred or received during transactions, which can lead to several issues:

1. **Fee on Transfer Tokens**:
    - Some ERC20 tokens deduct a fee during transfers. The `allocate` function does not account for this fee, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual transferred amounts.
2. **Rebasing Tokens**:
    - Rebasing tokens adjust their total supply periodically. The `allocate` function does not handle these adjustments, leading to incorrect balance calculations.
3. **Balance Modifications Outside Transfers**:
    - Some tokens modify balances outside of standard transfer operations (e.g., airdrops). The `allocate` function does not account for these modifications, causing potential accounting issues.

Consider the allocate function in ManagedBudget.sol:
```solidity
function allocate(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool) {
    Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
    if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH) {
        FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

        // Ensure the value received is equal to the `payload.amount`
        if (msg.value != payload.amount) {
            revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
        }
    } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
        FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

        // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
        request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
        if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
            revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
        }
    } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
        ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));

        // Transfer `payload.amount` of `payload.tokenId` to this contract
        IERC1155(request.asset).safeTransferFrom(
            request.target, address(this), payload.tokenId, payload.amount, payload.data
        );
        if (IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) < payload.amount) {
            revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
        }
    } else {
        // Unsupported asset type
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

```

## Impact

*  The `allocate` function transfers the specified `payload.amount` without accounting for potential fees or other balance modifications.
* The actual amount received by the contract might be less than the `payload.amount`, leading to incorrect balance checks and potential reverts.
