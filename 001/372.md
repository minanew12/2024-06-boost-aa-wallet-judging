# Protocol will not receive the correct share of fees on incentive claims.

### Summary

Internal function `_routeClaimFee` which is used to calculate the distribution of claim fees between the referrer, owner and the protocol does not consider the configured `protocolFee` for the respective boost.

### Root Cause

In [BoostCore.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L305-L320), the configured `boost.protocolFee` is not used to calculate the protocol fee, unlike the approach taken with the `referrerFee` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L311). Instead, the remaining portion of the fee, after the referrer receives their share, is divided between the owner and the protocol. This could potentially lead to the protocol receiving less than its expected share from the boost.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Referral fee should be set higher than the protocol fee
This should not be a constricting pre-condition since the questionnaire does not mention any relationship between the protocol fee and the referrer fee except that they are both bound by (0,10000) bps
2. `(boost.referralFee - 100) / 2 < boost.protocolFee`
This condition is based on point 1 but gets more specific on the setting of fee and a case of a boost initialized with such params is demonstrated in the POC below 
3. Boost owner and protocol fee receiver are different addresses

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss on a portion of fees that it receives on incentive claims potentially on all the boosts.

### PoC

This POC can be added as a test in `BoostCore.t.sol` to replicate the results
```solidity
function testPOC_ProtocolFeesOnClaim() public {
        //Create call data with 50% referrerFee and 30% protocol fee + the base fees of 10% each
        bytes memory validCreateCalldata2 = LibZip.cdCompress(
        abi.encode(
            BoostCore.InitPayload({
                budget: budget,
                action: action,
                validator: BoostLib.Target({isBase: true, instance: address(0), parameters: ""}),
                allowList: allowList,
                incentives: _makeIncentives(1),
                protocolFee: 3_000, // 30% so the total protocolFee would be 40% after adding the 10% base protocol fee
                referralFee: 5_000, // 50% so the total protocolFee would be 60% after adding the 10% base referral fee
                maxParticipants: 10_000,
                owner: address(5)
            })
        )
    );
        // Create a Boost first
        boostCore.createBoost(validCreateCalldata2);

        // Mint an ERC721 token to the claimant (this contract)
        uint256 tokenId = 1;
        mockERC721.mint{value: 0.1 ether}(address(this));
        mockERC721.mint{value: 0.1 ether}(address(this));
        mockERC721.mint{value: 0.1 ether}(address(this));

        // Prepare the data payload for validation
        bytes memory data = abi.encode(address(this), abi.encode(tokenId));

        //making sure the protocol fee reciever has 0 balance before the claim to avoid any discrepancies
        assertEq(boostCore.protocolFeeReceiver().balance, 0);

        // Claim the incentive
        boostCore.claimIncentive{value: 0.000075 ether}(0, 0, address(2), data);

        //Logging the balances after the claim
        BoostLib.Boost memory fetchedBoost = boostCore.getBoost(0);
        console2.log("Fetched protocol fee receiver native eth balance", boostCore.protocolFeeReceiver().balance);
        console2.log("Expected protocol fee reciver native eth balance", 0.000075 ether * uint256(fetchedBoost.protocolFee) / 10_000);
    }
```
The output logs showing the discrepancy in the expected fee received and actual fee received:
```bash
  Fetched protocol fee receiver native eth balance 15000000000000
  Expected protocol fee reciver native eth balance 30000000000000
```

### Mitigation

Calculate the protocolFee like what is done for referrer fee using `boost.protocolFee` and to make sure there are no lingering funds in the contract after the fees are sent to the protocol and the referrer there could be a check like: 
```solidity
if (address(this).balance != 0) {
     //sweep the funds
}
```
