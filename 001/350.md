# Boost creator will prevent protocol from receiving claim fee

### Summary

The percentage of fee sent to the referrer is not capped - if set high by the boost creator, the referrer will receive the entire claim fee supplied to the `BoostCore` and the protocol (`protocolFeeReceiver`) will not receive any fees.

`_routeClaimFee` in `BoostCore` handles payment of fees to the boost `owner`, `referrer` and `protocolFeeReceiver`.

```solidity
    function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }
```
As can be seen - the `referrer` can receive 100% of the claim fees if `boost.referralFee == FEE_DENOMINATOR`

### Root Cause

The percentage of claim fee sent to the referrer is not capped when creating a boost:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L122
```solidity
boost.referralFee = referralFee + payload_.referralFee;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Boost is created with a high `referralFee`
2. Claim is called
3. referrer receives the fees

### Impact

Protocol fees be lost

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a CAP on boost creation for the amount of `referralFee`
