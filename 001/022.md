# `allocate` in ManageBudget.sol does not work with fee on transfer token

## Summary
the function `allocate` in ManageBudget.sol  does not work with fee on transfer token.
## Vulnerability Detail
In function `allocate`, it calls `request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);` to transfer asset from target to `address(this)`.
And it compares the balance of `address(this)` and `payload.amount`.
```solidity 
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            //@audit fee on transfer
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
```
We all know that some ERC20 token have fee on transfer, the actually amount that receiver received is less than the amount. 
So if `request.asset` is the special ERC20token , it will revert.
## Impact
It will cause `allocate` doesn't work with fee on transfer token. This goes against what was mentioned in the introduction and works for any weird token.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

remove the `if` , because if the transfer failed, it will revert.
