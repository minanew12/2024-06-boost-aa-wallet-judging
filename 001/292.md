# Budget contracts are not compatible with fee on transfers tokens

### Summary

According to `README.md` the protocol "should work with all native and ERC20 tokens that adhere to standard including weird tokens", however, in the `allocate` function used in the budget contracts that the user can use, ERC20 with fee on transfer is not supported, since attempting to fund the budget with said token would revert.

### Root Cause

_ In the `allocate` function found in `ManagedBudget.sol::57`, `VestingBudget.sol::75` and `SimpleBudget.sol::66`. As with fee on transfer tokens, the balance of the contract will always < payload.amount:
