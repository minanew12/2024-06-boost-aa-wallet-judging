# Invalid Referrer Address Causes Blocks The Claim Of Incentive

Invalid Referrer Addrss Causes Blocks The Claim Of Incentive

## Summary

The `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` function routes claim fees to the creator, referrer, and protocol fee receiver. If the refferrer address is non-compliant or a contract that cannot receive Ether, The transfer is going to be failed. This failure can block the entire incentive distribution process, causing a critical disruption in the claim mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee`, the system transfers a portion of the claim fee to the referrer (if specified) using the `safeTransferETH` function. However, if `safeTransferETH` is called on a contract that is not compliant or capable of receiving Ether, it could revert the transaction. This would cause the entire claiming process to be blocked, preventing not only the referrer but also the Boost owner and the protocol from receiving their respective shares of the claim fee.

The root cause lies in the unchecked assumption that the referrer address can always receive Ether, which might not be true in all cases (e.g., smart contracts without a fallback function or reject Ether transfers).

## Impact

- If the Ether transfer to the referrer fails, the entire claim process is blocked.
- None of the involved parties (the referrer, Boost owner, or protocol) receive their share of the claim fee.
- It could cause significant disruption in the incentive claiming process, halting operations and frustrating users.

## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce error handling when transferring Ether to the referrer to prevent a single failure from blocking the entire claim process. Consider using try/catch for external calls like safeTransferETH, or utilize a method that allows non-blocking transfers, such as sending funds with a fallback option (e.g., storing the failed transfers to be claimed later by the referrer).
