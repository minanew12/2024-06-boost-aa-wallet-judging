# An incentive claimer can self-reference to pay less fees

### Summary

In `BoostCore`, users claim incentives by calling either `claimIncentive` or `claimIncentiveFor`, but eventually it calls [`claimIncentiveFor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L164) anyway, in the function, it's possible to set a referrer address, and it's possible to self-refer, when referrer fees is not zero, this user can pay less fees.

### Root Cause

As we see, when an incentive is claimed, fees will be collected, and distributed among referrers, boost owner and the protocol:
```solidity
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, function is nonReentrant)
        if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```

And in `_routeClaimFee`, it only checks if referrer address is zero:
```solidity
    function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
        protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
    }
```

This allows users to self-refer, by doing so, users can pay less fee than intended.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The boost has referrer ratio set to 50% by boost owner.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User can avoid paying full amount of fees, causing loss of funds for the boost owner and the protocol.

### PoC

1. A malicious actor claims incentive, but set referrer as himself.
2. For the sake of simplicity, the fee amount is 1000 wei, which means referrer will get 50% * 1000 = 500 wei, and the rest 500 is distributed equally between owner and the protocol. 
3. Since this user sets himself as referrer, so he essentially paid 500 wei for fees, avoiding to pay the rest 500 wei.

### Mitigation

Disable self-reference
