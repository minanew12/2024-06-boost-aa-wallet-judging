# Insufficient Handling of Fee-on-Transfer Tokens in the Boost Protocol

## Details

The Boost protocol, designed to support diverse incentive mechanisms using ERC20 tokens, faces challenges when handling "fee-on-transfer" tokens like PAXG. These tokens deduct a fee during transfers, causing discrepancies between the intended transfer amount and the actual amount received.

Unlike standard ERC20 tokens, where the recipient receives the exact amount sent, fee-on-transfer tokens reduce the transfer amount by a predetermined fee. This behavior disrupts the Boost protocol's assumptions about token balances and transfer outcomes, particularly within the ManagedBudget and incentive contracts.

## Code Snippets
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L296
```solidity
// ManagedBudget.sol
// ...
function _transferFungible(address asset_, address to_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual nonReentrant {
    // ...
    // Transfer the asset to the recipient
    if (asset_ == address(0)) {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(to_, amount_);
    } else {
        asset_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_); // Potential issue with fee-on-transfer tokens
    }

    emit Distributed(asset_, to_, amount_);
}
// ...
```

If asset_ represents a fee-on-transfer token like PAXG, the recipient (to_) would receive less than amount_ due to the fee deduction during the safeTransfer. However, the _transferFungible function operates under the assumption that amount_ is transferred in full, potentially leading to an inconsistency between the contract's internal accounting (e.g., the _distributedFungible mapping) and the actual token balances.

## Impact

The unique behavior of fee-on-transfer tokens introduces the following concerns:

Inaccurate Incentive Distribution: When disbursing incentives using a fee-on-transfer token, the intended recipient would receive a reduced amount.

Accounting Discrepancies: The Boost contract's internal accounting, assuming standard ERC20 transfers, wouldn't accurately reflect the actual token balances, as it wouldn't account for the transfer fees.

Budget Shortfalls: Using fee-on-transfer tokens for incentive disbursement could lead to budget shortfalls over time, as the accumulated transfer fees might deplete the allocated funds.

## Scenario

- A user creates a Boost offering incentives in PAXG, a fee-on-transfer token.
- A user, having successfully met the Boost's requirements, attempts to claim their PAXG incentive.
- The claim function in the incentive contract interacts with the ManagedBudget to transfer the PAXG reward. During the safeTransfer call within _transferFungible, a fee is deducted from the transferred amount.
- The user receives a lower PAXG amount than the intended reward specified in the Boost.
- The ManagedBudget contract, unaware of the fee deduction, updates its internal state as if the entire reward amount was transferred, leading to a discrepancy.

## Fix

After executing a transfer involving a fee-on-transfer token, immediately query the recipient's balance to determine the actual amount received.

Reconcile this received amount with the intended transfer amount, updating the Boost contract's internal accounting accordingly.
