# ``allocate`` with not work for certain tokens

## Summary
After performing ``safeTransferFrom`` by ``allocate`` function, it check if ``balanceOf`` of contract is smaller than input amount and reverts if that's the case. But this will be true in case of tokens that charge fee on transfer and revert will always happen. 
## Vulnerability Detail
When you call ``allocate`` you provide calldata in the form of ``Transfer`` struct.

After transfer happens the function checks: 
```Solidity
 if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) { 
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
```
The problem here is that this will always revert for Fee On Transfer Tokens so allocation cannot happen. 

## Impact
Allocation of FOT tokens cannot happens causing boost to fail essentially.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Compute before transfer balance and after transfer balance and use the subtracted value( amount - fee ) to compare with balanceOf
