# FoT tokens will not work with budget

### Summary

FoT tokens will not work with budget

### Root Cause

The protocol intends to work with any weird tokens:

> Protocol should work with all native and ERC20 tokens that adhear to standard including weird tokens. No assumptions are made in regards to the properties of integrating tokens and weird trait tokens should be handled normally. Specifically we'd expect to interact with USDT and other stable coins/decimal 6 coins and erc20z from Zora as well as other fractional NFT contracts as long as they adhere to ERC20 standard. We aren't whitelisting tokens so any erc20 should work (including weird ones).

However FoT tokens will not work in the `ManagedBudget.sol`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L66-L74
```solidity
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract

            // @audit - FoT
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        }
```
as we can see, we transfer `payload.amount` to the budget. If FoT tokens are used the balance of the budget will be less than the `payload.amount` and then `request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount` will be true, causing a revert.
