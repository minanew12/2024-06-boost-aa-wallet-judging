# Incorrect Fee Distribution in `_routeClaimFee` Function


## Summary

The [`_routeClaimFee` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L305-L319) in the `BoostCore` contract incorrectly splits the remaining fee in half, ignoring the `protocolFee` parameter, leading to incorrect fee distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`_routeClaimFee` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L305-L319) does not account for the `protocolFee` parameter, causing the protocol fee receiver to receive an overpayment and the boost owner to receive less than intended.

## Impact

The protocol fee receiver receives more funds than it should, while the boost owner receives less, leading to financial discrepancies.

## Recommendation

Modify the `_routeClaimFee` function to correctly calculate and distribute the protocol's share based on the `protocolFee` parameter.
