# Protocol doesn't account for tokens that charge fee on transfer, rebasing or similar token types

## Summary

Protocol doesn't account for tokens that charge fee on transfer which will affect accounting, cause certain functions to fail, or cause users to incur extra charges in order to handle the functions. Tokens that negatively rebase may cause claims to sometimes fail and positive rebases (or airdrop) from those token types will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

From provided info, the protocol plans on working with all token types, including weird ones, ergo fee on transfer tokens. But the way transfers are handled doesn't account for this which could lead a number of unexpected behaviours.

## Impact

Some of the impacts include:
- Recipients will receive less amounts than expected.

- Allocation on ManagedBudget.sol will always fail, and the allocator will be forced to seperately send extra tokens to the contract, causing him to get charged twice and losing funds.
This is because the allocate function first transfers the payload amount to the contract, then compares the asset balance with the payload amount. But due to fees, the balance will be lesser than payload amount transferred in, causing the function to revert.

```solidity
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        }
```
and so on

## Recommendation

Consider if fee-on-transfer, rebase, or any similar tokens should be supported. If so, add before and after balance checks before transfers help. Introdcing balance tracking systems and sweep functions to skim off excess tokens.
