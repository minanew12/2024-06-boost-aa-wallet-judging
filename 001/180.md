# Protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens

## Summary
Fee on transfer tokens transfer less tokens in than what would be expect. This means that the protocol request incorrect amounts when dealing with these tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
There are some places in the code that assume the ERC20 transfer function will transfer a specified amount and this is not true for tokens with fee. This will cause wrong calculation results in those cases. Some of the places where this issue happens:

and there is more

Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. STA, PAXG), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. USDT, USDC).
