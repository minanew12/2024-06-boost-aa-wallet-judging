# `claimIncentiveFor` doesn't return excess value and  transfer without using `protocolFee`, which cause user may pay more protocolFee

## Summary
`claimIncentiveFor` doesn't return excess value. When contract  pay protocolFee to protocolFeeReceiver, it doesn't use the fixed `protocolFee`  but use `address(this).balance` . Combining the above two situations will cause users to pay too much protocolFee.
## Vulnerability Detail
Use can call `claimIncentiveFor` to claim incentive and user should pay claim fee first. But  the contract doesn't return excess vaule that user transfer to contract. This results in users being unable to reclaim the excess claimFee they paid.
```solidity
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee); // doesn't return excess value 
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);
        if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```
In addition, when the contract pays the protocol fee, it does not use the `protocolFee variable` from the contract, but instead uses the balance within the contract. This causes the excess claim fee paid by the user to be transferred to the protocol fee receiver.

```solidity
protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance); // use address(this).balance 
```

poc is below
```solidity
    function testPOC3() public {
        bytes memory CreateCalldata = LibZip.cdCompress(
            abi.encode(
            BoostCore.InitPayload({
                budget: budget,
                action: action,
                validator: BoostLib.Target({isBase: true, instance: address(0), parameters: ""}),
                allowList: allowList,
                incentives: _makeIncentives(1),
                protocolFee: 500, // 5%
                referralFee: 1000, // 10%
                maxParticipants: 10_000,
                owner: address(1)
                })
            )
        );
        uint256 tokenId = 1;
        mockERC721.mint{value: 0.1 ether}(address(this));
        mockERC721.mint{value: 0.1 ether}(address(this));
        mockERC721.mint{value: 0.1 ether}(address(this));
        boostCore.createBoost(validCreateCalldata);

        address receiver = makeAddr("receiver"); 
        boostCore.setProtocolFeeReceiver(receiver);
        vm.deal(address(this), 1 ether); 
        console.log("User balance before call ClaimIncentive: ", address(this).balance); 
        bytes memory data = abi.encode(address(this), abi.encode(tokenId));
        boostCore.claimIncentive{value: 1 ether}(0, 0, address(0), data);
        console.log("User balance after call ClaimIncentive:", address(this).balance); 
        console.log("balance of protocolFeeReceiver", receiver.balance);
    }
```
output
```solidity
[PASS] testPOC3() (gas: 2728693)
Logs:
  User balance before call ClaimIncentive:  1000000000000000000
  User balance after call ClaimIncentive: 0

```

## Impact
This issue should be high. It causes users to pay additional fees.

contract should return excess value to `msg.sender`
