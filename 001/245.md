# Fee-on-Transfer Token Incompatibility in ManagedBudget Contract

## Summary

The ManagedBudget contract does not properly support fee-on-transfer (FOT) tokens. When users attempt to allocate FOT tokens to the budget, the transaction will revert unexpectedly. This limitation prevents users from using FOT tokens with the protocol, leading to failed transactions and a poor user experience.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ⁠ allocate ⁠ function in the ManagedBudget contract assumes that the full amount of tokens specified in the transaction will be received. However, for FOT tokens, a fee is deducted during transfer, resulting in the contract receiving fewer tokens than expected. The contract then checks if the received amount matches the expected amount, causing a revert when it doesn't match.

Specifically, in the ⁠ allocate ⁠ function:

1.⁠ ⁠The contract calls ⁠ safeTransferFrom ⁠ to transfer tokens.
2.⁠ ⁠It then checks if the contract's balance is at least the expected amount.
3.⁠ ⁠For FOT tokens, the actual received amount is less than expected, triggering an ⁠ InvalidAllocation ⁠ error.

## Impact

1.⁠ ⁠Users cannot use FOT tokens with the protocol, limiting the types of tokens that can be managed.
2.⁠ ⁠Attempted allocations with FOT tokens will always fail, potentially causing confusion and frustration for users.
3.⁠ ⁠This could lead to a loss of potential users and use-cases for the protocol.

## Code Snippet

```solidity

function allocate(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool) {
    Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
    if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
        FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

        // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
        request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
        if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {  
            revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
        }
    }
    // ... rest of the function
}

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue and potentially support FOT tokens, consider implementing the following changes:

```solidity

uint256 balanceBefore = request.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
uint256 balanceAfter = request.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 actualReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;

if (actualReceived < payload.amount) {
    revert;
}

```

⁠Implement a balance check before and after the token transfer to determine the actual amount received.
