# Incorrect Fee Distribution will Lead to Overpayment to Protocol Fee Receiver

### Summary

A missing consideration of the `protocolFee` parameter in the [`_routeClaimFee` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L305-L319) will cause an incorrect fee distribution for the protocol fee receiver as the function splits the remaining fee in half instead of using the `protocolFee` parameter.


### Root Cause

In `boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol` the [`_routeClaimFee` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L305-L319) does not account for the [`protocolFee` parameter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L66-L67) , leading to incorrect fee distribution.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `claimFee` must be greater than 0.
2. The `protocolFee` parameter must be set in the `BoostLib.Boost` struct.

### External pre-conditions

1. The contract must have a non-zero balance to distribute the fees.


### Attack Path

1. A user calls the `claimIncentive` or `claimIncentiveFor` function.
2. The `_routeClaimFee` function is invoked to distribute the claim fee.
3. The function incorrectly splits the remaining fee in half, ignoring the `protocolFee` parameter.
4. The protocol fee receiver receives the entire remaining balance of the contract, which could include leftover funds from previous transactions.

### Impact

The protocol fee receiver suffers an approximate overpayment due to the incorrect fee distribution. The boost owner receives less than intended, and the protocol fee receiver might receive more funds than it should.


### PoC

1. A user calls the `claimIncentive` function:
   ```solidity
   function claimIncentive(uint256 boostId_, uint256 incentiveId_, address referrer_, bytes calldata data_)
       external
       payable
   {
       claimIncentiveFor(boostId_, incentiveId_, referrer_, data_, msg.sender);
   }
   ```

2. The `_routeClaimFee` function is invoked:
   ```solidity
   function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
       if (claimFee == 0) return;
       uint256 netFee = claimFee;

       // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
       if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
           uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
           netFee -= referralShare;
           referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
       }

       // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
       boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
       protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
   }
   ```

3. The function splits the remaining fee in half, ignoring the `protocolFee` parameter, leading to incorrect fee distribution.


### Mitigation

The `_routeClaimFee` function should be modified to use the `protocolFee` parameter for fee distribution. Here is the corrected function:

```diff
function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
    if (claimFee == 0) return;
    uint256 netFee = claimFee;

    // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
    if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
        uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
        netFee -= referralShare;
        referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
    }

    // Calculate the protocol's share based on the boost's protocolFee
+   uint256 protocolShare = netFee * boost.protocolFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
+   uint256 ownerShare = netFee - protocolShare;

    // Transfer the calculated shares
-   boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
-   protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
+   boost.owner.safeTransferETH(ownerShare);
+   protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(protocolShare);
}
```
