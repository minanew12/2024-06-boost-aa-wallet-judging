# BoostCore.sol::claimIncentiveFor: User can overspend and tokens would get send to protocol

### Summary

The function [BoostCore.sol::claimIncentiveFor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L164-L180) allows the user to overspend tokens when claiming incentives. This would lead to more token as intended getting send to the protocol fee receiver.

### Root Cause

The function [BoostCore.sol::claimIncentiveFor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L164-L180) only checks if the user send **at least** the necessary amount by reverting if `msg.value < claimFee`. 

This allows the user to send more than needed, and as the function does not have any refund logic, the tokens would be send to the protocol fee receiver.

User could loose money depending on his transaction settings.

### Mitigation

Either update the check to allow only the right amount of msg.value, like so:
```solidity
if (msg.value != claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
```

Or add refund logic to return the tokens, by adding sth like this to the end of the `claimIncentiveFor` function:
```solidity
if (msg.value > claimFee) payable(msg.sender).safeTransferETH(msg.value - claimFee);
```
