# `DoS` attack on the `ManagedBudget.allocate()` function

### Summary

The `ManagedBudget.allocate()` function is designed to transfer assets from a target address using the `safeTransferFrom` method, which requires that the target address has already approved the necessary amount. However, the `ManagedBudget.allocate()` function lacks access controls, allowing attackers to call it to transfer just 1 wei from the target. This action decreases the approved amount, causing any subsequent attempts to transfer the original required amount to revert due to insufficient approval.

### Root Cause

Since the [allocate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet-davies0212/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L57) function lacks access controls, attackers can exploit this vulnerability by front-running calls to the function.

```solidity
    function allocate(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool) {
        Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
        if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Ensure the value received is equal to the `payload.amount`
            if (msg.value != payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
            ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of `payload.tokenId` to this contract
            IERC1155(request.asset).safeTransferFrom(
                request.target, address(this), payload.tokenId, payload.amount, payload.data
            );
            if (IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else {
            // Unsupported asset type
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The budget admin calls the `allocate()` function to transfer 1000 assets from the target, which has already approved this amount to the budget contract.

2. An attacker front-runs this call to the `allocate()` function, setting the transfer amount to 1.

    - As a result, 1 asset is transferred from the target to the budget contract,
    - and the approved amount is reduced to 1000 - 1 = 999.
3. When the admin's transaction is processed, it fails because the approved amount has already been decreased to 999, while the transaction attempts to transfer 1000 assets.

### Impact

Attackers can disrupt the allocation process.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `allocate()` function should implement appropriate access controls.
