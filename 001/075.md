# Protocol does not work with fee-on-transfer tokens

### Summary

Protocol does not work with fee-on-transfer tokens, although README says that protocol should work with all ERC20 tokens including weird tokens:
>We aren't whitelisting tokens so any erc20 should work (including weird ones).

### Root Cause

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L70-L72](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L70-L72)
```solidity
} else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount); 
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {  
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

User wants to allocate FOT token to the budget.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `allocate()` function from budget contract.
2. The function reverts due to this check:
```solidity
if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {  
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount); 
            }
```
Actual transfered amount will always be less than amount specified in `safeTransferFrom()` function.


### Impact

Some assets cannot be allocated to budget making it useless.

### PoC

No need.

### Mitigation

Remove this redundant check:
```solidity
if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
```
