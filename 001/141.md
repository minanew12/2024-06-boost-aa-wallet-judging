# Unsupported fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
Fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported in any of the incentives contracts, violating the specification that `Protocol should work with all native and ERC20 tokens that adhear to standard including weird tokens.`

## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a boost, the `_makeIncentives` contract is called, which uses the provided `budget` to make necessary disbursements for initialization:

```solidity
    function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
...
        boost.incentives = _makeIncentives(payload_.incentives, payload_.budget);

    function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
...
            bytes memory preflight = incentives[i].preflight(targets_[i].parameters);
            if (preflight.length != 0) {
                // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
                assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
            }


            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
            incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
        }
    }
```

In the incentives contracts that use ERC20 tokens, the same pattern is used for `preflight` and `initialize`. WLOG, the pattern for `CGDAIncentive`:

```solidity
    function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
        uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (available < init_.totalBudget) {
            revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, init_.totalBudget);
        }
...

    function preflight(bytes calldata data_) external view virtual override returns (bytes memory) {
        InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));

        return abi.encode(
            ABudget.Transfer({
                assetType: ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
                asset: init_.asset,
                target: address(this),
                data: abi.encode(ABudget.FungiblePayload({amount: init_.totalBudget}))
            })
        );
    }
```

The critical error is that `preflight` provides the `init_.totalBudget` parameter to the budget for disbursement, which will then transfer that exact amount via the `disburse` function. However, the amount that is received will have a deducted fee on transfer, and will necessarily be less than the amount requested at the time of disbursement. Thus the check `if (available < _init.totalBudget)` will always fail for these tokens.

The issue also applies to the `allocate` function of `ManagedBudget` (but is of lower severity since this function is extraneous anyways and users can directly transfer assets to the budget)

```solidity
    function allocate(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool) {
...
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
```

## Impact
Deviation from specification. Fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported in any of the ERC20 incentives across all boosts, nor are they supported in allocations to `ManagedBudget`.

## Recommendation
Consider removing the balance check, or alternatively keep it and allow some tolerance for a fee in order to support these types of tokens.
