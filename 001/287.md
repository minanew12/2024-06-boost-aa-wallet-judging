# Denial of service for `ManagedBudged::allocate` when asset token type is `AssetType.ERC20` "Fee on Transfer" token.

## Summary

As Protocol wants to work with all ERC20 tokens including weird ones as well.
Below is the screenshot of the contest page of "Boost Core Incentive Protocol", this is the proof of my above statement.

âœ… Denial of service for `ManagedBudged::allocate` when asset token type is `AssetType.ERC20` "Fee on Transfer" token.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function safeTransferFrom may not transfer exactly `payload.amount` amount of tokens, for ERC20 tokens with a fee on transfer. 

Therefore the allocation for any fee on transfer token is not possible, because of this check - 
```solidity
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
  @>        if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
``` 
Explanation:
- first, the transfer of ERC20 asset tokens will happen through the function `safeTransferFrom`
Now here, as the ERC20 asset token is a fee on transfer token, so in this case, the amount transferred in the contract would be a little less than the exact `payload.amount` amount.

- So here in this case the next line check which is been made will always revert for the first time allocation of assets itself. Meaning allocation of those assets will never be possible as the function will always revert on that check.

## Impact
- It will be impossible to "Allocate assets to the budget". 
- Without allocation to the `ManagedBudget` contract no `Disburse`(transfer assets from the budget to a single recipient) can happen.
- So basically both the main functionalities of the whole `ManagedBudged.sol` contract gets broken.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to find the balance of the asset in the current contract before and after the `safeTransferFrom` to see how many tokens were received, and then accordingly make a check with the difference of before and after asset balance.
