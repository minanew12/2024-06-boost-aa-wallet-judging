# ManagedBudget.sol allocate does not correctly check for transfer amount

### Summary

The [ManagedBudget.sol::allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L57-L90) function does not correctly validate the transferred amount of ERC20 or ERC1155 tokens, as it only looks at the total balance and not the transferred amount. As the "[p]rotocol should work with all native and ERC20 tokens that adhear to standard including weird tokens" ([contest description](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/README.md#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate)), transfer functions need to keep this in mind.

### Root Cause

The [ManagedBudget.sol::allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L57-L90) function validates that the balance is not less than the transfer amount:
```solidity
if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
    revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
}
```
```solidity
if (IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) < payload.amount) {
    revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
}
```

But this is always true if the contract already received some tokens. To correctly check the amount it needs to compare the balance before and after the transfer.

### PoC

Consider this case:
First userA allocates 100 tokens.

Now userB allocates 50 tokens, but as it is a wired token userB pays a fee on transfer and only 40 tokens arrive in the manager contract. The contract now looks at the balance and compares it to the amount: 
  -  request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) = 140 tokens
  - payload.amount = 50 tokens
  - 140 tokens < 50 tokens => false, allocation does not revert

### Mitigation

Update the function to compare the balance change to the intended amount. For example the ERC20 art could be updates like this:
