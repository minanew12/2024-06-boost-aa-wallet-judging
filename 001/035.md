# Claimants can redeem a certain percentage of the claimFee by setting themselves as the referrer

## Summary
Referral can be abused by the claimant. 
## Vulnerability Detail

To claim an incentive, the claimer is charged a claimFee in native ETH, which is later distributed to the referrer (if passed as param), the boost owner, and the protocolFeeReceiver in that order. 

```solidity
    function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
        protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
    }
```

The issue is, the referrals can set themselves as the referrer to claim a percentage of the fee, ultimately paying less than they actually should.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a sanitary check,
```solidity
   if (msg.sender == referrer_) revert InvalidReferrer();  
```
