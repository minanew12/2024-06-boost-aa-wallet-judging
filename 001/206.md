# Protocol Fee Can Be 0

## Summary

The Readme says ->

`Boost creators are trusted to not prevent incentives claims.`

but this issue is different from preventing claims , it talks about how a boost can be configured so that protocol fees is 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) The creator creates a boost ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L106

2.) The default referral fees is 1000 (L70) which is 10% , now the creator when creating the boost can provide referral fee as 9000 i.e. the ` payload_.referralFee` ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L122

Therefore , now the total referral fee is 10000  i,e, 100%

3.) When the incentive is claimed for this boost , the fee is charged ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L173

```solidity
function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
        protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
    }
```

As you can see since 10000 is referralFee  , `referralShare` would be the entire claimFee amount and the entire fee amount would go the referrer (can be the user itself also who is claiming so that in total he pays 0 fees) and 0 to the protocol as there is no ETH left now after paying the referrer

## Impact

The protocol would make 0 profits on this boost.

## Recommendation

There should be a max cap on the referral fee and a min cap on the protocol fee
