# Balance Check Before Transfer

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The _routeClaimFee function is responsible for distributing the claim fee among the boost owner, referrer (if any), and the protocol fee receiver. 

This line attempts to transfer the entire remaining balance of the contract to the protocolFeeReceiver. It assumes that the remaining balance is equal to the protocol's share of the claim fee. However, this assumption might not always hold true.

Attack Scenario:

Deplete Contract Balance: An attacker (or a group of attackers colluding) could make a series of claims, carefully choosing referral fees and amounts to gradually drain the contract's ETH balance. They might exploit rounding errors in the referral fee calculation (as mentioned in the audit comment) to maximize their gains.

Trigger a Failing Claim: Once the contract's ETH balance is sufficiently low, a legitimate user attempts to make a claim.

Insufficient Funds: The _routeClaimFee function executes. It correctly transfers the referral share (if applicable) and the boost owner's share. However, when it reaches the line to transfer the protocol fee, the contract doesn't have enough ETH to cover the full amount.

Transaction Reverts: The safeTransferETH call to the protocolFeeReceiver fails due to insufficient funds. This causes the entire claimIncentiveFor transaction to revert.

Let's say the claimFee is 100 wei, and the protocol fee is 10%.

- The attacker makes several claims, draining the contract's balance to 5 wei.
- A legitimate user tries to make a claim.
- The _routeClaimFee function calculates the protocol fee as 10 wei (10% of 100 wei).
- The contract only has 5 wei, so the transfer to the protocolFeeReceiver fails, reverting the entire claim transaction.

## Recommendation
```solidity
// Calculate the protocol share first
uint256 protocolShare = address(this).balance; 

// Ensure sufficient balance
require(protocolShare >= protocolFeeReceiver.balance, "Insufficient balance for protocol fee");

// Transfer the protocol share
protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(protocolShare); 
```
