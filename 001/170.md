# Missing referrer validation allows fraudulent claim of referral rewards

## Summary
The `claimIncentiveFor` function in the `BoostCore` contract allows users to claim incentives on behalf of others while also specifying a referrer. However, there is no validation to check if the `referrer_` address provided is a legitimate referrer. Malicious actors can exploit this by passing their own address as `referrer_`, earning referral rewards without contributing to actual referrals. This poses a financial risk to the system by allowing dishonest users to claim referral fees fraudulently and depriving legitimate referrers of their rightful earnings.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor()` takes several parameters, including a `referrer_` address. It uses this address to route a portion of the claim fee to the referrer. However, there is no check in place to validate whether the `referrer_` is eligible to receive the referral reward. This opens the possibility for malicious actors to pass their own address as the `referrer_` and earn the referral share of the claim fee, even if they have not referred the claimant.


```solidity
function claimIncentiveFor(
    uint256 boostId_,
    uint256 incentiveId_,
@>  address referrer_,
    bytes calldata data_,
    address claimant
) public payable nonReentrant {
    BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
    if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
@>  _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

    if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
    if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
        revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
    }
}
```

The `_routeClaimFee` function is responsible for transferring a portion of the claim fee to the `referrer_`:

```solidity
function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
    if (claimFee == 0) return;
    uint256 netFee = claimFee;

    // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
    if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
@>      uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
        netFee -= referralShare;
@>      referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
    }

    // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
    boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
    protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
}
```

Since the `referrer_` address is accepted without any checks, a malicious user can monitor the system. When they see that a legitimate user has completed the required action and is about to claim their reward, they can send a transaction before the user, specifying the userâ€™s address as the `claimant` and passing their own address as the `referrer_`, thereby exploiting the system to collect referral fees.

## Impact
**Financial Loss**: Malicious actors can fraudulently earn referral rewards without contributing legitimate referrals, resulting in direct financial losses to legitimate referrers.

## Tool Used
VSCode 

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, a validation check should be added to ensure that the `referrer_` is an eligible referrer before they can receive the referral reward.

Example Fix: 

```diff
function claimIncentiveFor(
    uint256 boostId_,
    uint256 incentiveId_,
    address referrer_,
    bytes calldata data_,
    address claimant
) public payable nonReentrant {
    BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
    if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
+   if(referrer != boost.referrer) revert();
    _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

    if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
    if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
        revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
    }
}
```

This filed (`boost.referrer`) currently does not exist but could be added, or protocol team can implement other eligibility check as well!
