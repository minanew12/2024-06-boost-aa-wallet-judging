# ManagedBudget::allocate() can wrongly validate some allocations

## Summary
ManagedBudget::allocate() could wrongly validate some allocations 

## Vulnerability Detail
ManagedBudget::allocate() validates ```if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount)``` to make sure the contract receives the expected token amount. However, this will not work if the contract already has a token balance different from 0. 

## Impact
The contract will not revert when receiving less tokens than expected, this will be an issue when allocating a ERC20 fee-on-transfer token if the contract already has a balance greater than 0 of that token.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Best mitigation for this issue is to compare the balance of the token before and after transfer in the ERC20 part of ```ManagedBudget::allocate()```. This way you can be sure of the received token amount. In case of acceptance of fee-on-transfer tokens, just adjust the difference between balances with the token's fee.

} else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
 FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
+          uint256 balanceBefore = request.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
-            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
+           if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount + balanceBefore) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
