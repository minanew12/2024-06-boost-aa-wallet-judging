# A boost creator can deny fee to ``protocolFeeReceiver``

## Summary
The ``claimFee`` generated during ``claimIncentiveFor`` gets divided to ``referrer`` and ``protocolFeeReceiver``. Referrer share is decided by the referralPercentage configured during boost creation. Since there's no upper limit on this, a boost creator can configure referral fee as 100% such that no fee is transferred to ``protocolFeeReceiver`` . 

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's looks that ``_routeClaimFee()`` function which is invoked when ``claimIncentiveFor`` is called. 

```Solidity
    function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
        protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
    }
```
Here we configure referral share from the ``claimFee`` based on the ``referralFee`` provided during boost configuration.
So if we can find a way to make it 100% then all of the fee will be routed to ``referrer_`` which could be anyone. 

Let's looks at the ``referralFee``  configuration
```Solidity
  boost.referralFee = referralFee + payload_.referralFee;
```
Here referralFee is state variable hardcoded to 10% or 1000 bps. If we make ``payload_.referralFee`` as 9000 bps or 90% then during ``_routeClaimFee`` calculation, all of the amount will go to referrer and protocol receiver will get 0. 


## Impact
Protocol will not be able to generate any fee when claims are invoked causing loss of funds for the protocol

## Recommendation
Implement an upper limit during referral fee configuration.
