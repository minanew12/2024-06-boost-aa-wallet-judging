# Protocol fee settings not used in BoostCore contract

### Summary

The improper utilization of protocol fees in the BoostCore contract will cause a loss of potential revenue for the protocol and mislead Boost creators about the fees they're paying, as the protocol will fail to apply set fees correctly during claim fee distribution.


### Root Cause

In BoostCore.sol, while a protocol fee is set during Boost creation, it is not used in the claim fee calculation. Only a fixed 50% split is used. Specifically:

During Boost creation, the protocol fee is set:

```solidity
function createBoost(bytes calldata data_) external canCreateBoost(msg.sender) nonReentrant returns (BoostLib.Boost memory) {
    // ...
    boost.protocolFee = protocolFee + payload_.protocolFee;
    // ...
}
```
However, in the _routeClaimFee function, which handles fee distribution, a fixed 50% split is used instead of the set protocol fee:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L317-L318

```solidity
function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
    // ...
    // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
    boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
    protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

The protocol suffers a loss of potential fee revenue when the set protocol fee is higher than 50%. Boost creators may be misled about the fees they're paying, potentially leading to incorrect financial projections or decisions. For example, if the protocol fee is set to 70%, the protocol loses 20% of the potential fee revenue on each claim. Similarly, if using default params and no boost specific protocol fee, boost owner may think they are only paying 10% but they may be paying more in fee to protocol.
