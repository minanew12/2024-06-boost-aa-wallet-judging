# Budget allocation will break in case of a fee on transfer ERC 20 token

### Summary

[Docs ](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/426?filter=questions) mention that the protocol should work with all kinds of weird tokens but a fee on transfer token won't be allocated to the budget since the allocate function in ManagedBudget.sol reverts when the balance of the asset is lesser than the amount mentioned in the payload.

### Root Cause

[`ManagedBudget.sol:71`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L71): This check prevents the use of fee on transfer tokens since the allocated tokens actually transferred to the contract's balance will always be lesser than the payload amount owing to the fee component. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol will not be able to use fee on transfer tokens which they clearly want to use according to the questionnaire they answered.

### PoC

This is  a mock ERC20 fee on transfer token used for the POC
```solidity 
contract FeeOnTransferMockERC20 is ERC20("MOCK","MOCK"){
    uint FEE = 10000;
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        _balances[to] += amount;
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        require(amount > FEE);
        _balances[msg.sender] = _balances[msg.sender] - amount;
        _balances[to] = _balances[msg.sender] + amount - FEE;
        return true;
    }

    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint amount) public {
        transferFrom(from, to, amount);
    }
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint amount)  public override returns(bool){
        require(amount > FEE);
        _balances[from] = _balances[from] - amount;
        _balances[to] = _balances[from] + amount - FEE;
        return true;
    }

    function mintPayable(address to, uint256 amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value >= amount / 100, "MockERC20: gimme more money!");
        mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```
The test to be added to ManagedBudget.t.sol to replicate the results

```solidity
function testFeeOnTransfer() public{
        //deploy a feeon transfer mock token and mint tokens to this address
        mockFeeOnTransferERC20 = new FeeOnTransferMockERC20();
        mockFeeOnTransferERC20.mint(address(this), 100 ether);

        managedBudget = ManagedBudget(payable(LibClone.clone(address(new ManagedBudget()))));
        managedBudget.initialize(
            abi.encode(
                ManagedBudget.InitPayload({owner: address(this), authorized: new address[](0), roles: new uint256[](0)})
            )
        );
        mockFeeOnTransferERC20.approve(address(managedBudget), 100 ether);
        bytes memory data = _makeFungibleTransfer(ABudget.AssetType.ERC20, address(mockFeeOnTransferERC20), address(this), 100 ether);
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(ABudget.InvalidAllocation.selector, address(mockFeeOnTransferERC20), uint256(100 ether)));
        managedBudget.allocate(data);

    }
```
The test passes which means the `managedBudget.allocate(data)` call reverts with an `InvalidAllocation` error

### Mitigation

This one is tricky since there are 2 paths the sponsor can take:
1. Remove the support for fee on transfer tokens and mention this explicitly 
2. Keep supporting fee on transfer tokens and remove the aforementioned check.
