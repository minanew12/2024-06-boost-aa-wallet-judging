# Users can lose funds if `claimFee` is lowered between them submitting a `claimIncentive` transaction and the transaction being confirmed

## Summary

`claimIncentiveFor` allows users to send a msg.value that is greater than the claimFee. 

[BoostCore.sol#L164-180](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L164-L180)
```solidity
BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee); // @audit-medium no refund if claimFee is lowered and user already submitted
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);
```

It is possible, albeit unlikely, that a user can submit a `claimIncentive` transaction after the owner submits a `setClaimFee` transaction, but prior to the owner's transaction being confirmed. In this case, the user will send a msg.value that is greater than the claim fee and lose the excess ETH.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either require that `msg.value == claimFee` or refund users for excess ETH sent.
