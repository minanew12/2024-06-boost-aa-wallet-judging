# Attacker Can Transfer Victim's ERC1155 Token To The Budget

## Summary

Funds are allocated to the budget contract and these funds can be either ERC20 , ETH , or ERC1155 tokens , if the token is ERC1155 than an attacker can transfer unintended tokens approved by the victim to the budget and those tokens will get lost forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) Alice wants to allocate funds to a budget , she approves her ERC1155 tokenId 1 with amount as 5 to the budget.

2.) According to ERC1155 you can not approve a certain Id of the ERC1155 and a certain amount , therefore Alice needs to approve all of the tokens to the budget

3.) Aside from tokenId 1 Alice also had tokenId 2 in her account with an amount of 10 total.

4.) Therefore now she has approved all her tokens to the budget and she will call allocate() on the budget

5.) Bob calls allocate (frontrunning alice or before she could revoke her approval) , and in the data field which gets decoded to a Transfer struct he provides `request.target` as Alice and the `request.tokenId` as the tokenId2 and amount as 10 which alice didnt intend to transfer but it has been approved.

6.) Now the tokenId 2 would be transferred to the budget from Alice's account even when she intended to only transfer  tokenId1.

## Impact

Alice lost her tokens , this is permanent loss of funds for alice.
