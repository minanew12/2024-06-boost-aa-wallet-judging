# `protocolFeeReceiver` can sometimes receive more fees than expected

### Summary

Everytime when a user claims his incentive, the protocol fee receiver will receive the whole balance of the contract `BoostCore`, which can be way more than expected as a user can send more ETH than the fee required.


### Root Cause

The function `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` is responsible to route the claim fee to the creator, referrer, and protocol fee receiver. It basically starts with the received `claimeFee` in ETH by sending a portion to the referer, then giving half of the rest to the boost creator. However, instead of sending what has left of the received `claimeFee`, it sends the whole current balance of ETH in the contract `BoostCore` to the protocol fee receiver.

```javascript

function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
>>      protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
}

```


### Internal pre-conditions

NA

### External pre-conditions

- A user sends more fees than expected.
- Another user claims at the same time his incentive.

### Attack Path

NA

### Impact

There are several potential impacts:
- Another user sends ETH to claim his incentive can have his transaction revert as the current `BoostCore` balance is 0
- A user will have his remaining ETH after deduction of claim fee sent to the protocol fee receiver.

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

The protocol should only receive what has left of `claimFee` and send back the remaining to the end user.

        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
-       protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
+       protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(netFee - netFee / 2);
+       if (msg.value > claimFee) {
+           address(msg.sender).safeTransferETH(msg.value - claimFee);
+       }
}
