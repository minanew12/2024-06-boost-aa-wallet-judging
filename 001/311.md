# Protocol can lose 100% of it's claim fee procentage

### Summary

Lack of input validation in `createBoost` function, allows boost creator to set `referralFee` to 100% of the claimFee. It will lead to loss of funds for the protocol.

### Root Cause

In `createBoost` function there is no input validation. Boost creator can set `referralFee` to 100%.

In `_routeClaimFee` function, referralFee is sent first to the referrer and then the remaining amount is split between the boost owner and the protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

Boost creator needs to call `createBoost` with `payload_.referralFee` equal to `9000`.

`referralFee` (1000) + `payload_.referralFee` (9000) = 10000 (100% in bps)


### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Boost creator calls `createBoost` function with `payload_.referralFee` equal to `9000`.
2. User calls `claimIncentiveFor` with his address and all ether is returned to his address.

### Impact

The protocol suffers loss of 100% claimFee procentage. User can claim for free.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Validate `referralFee` passed by boost creator. If the protocol fee is greater than zero the referralFee should not be greater than 10000 - `protocolFee`.
