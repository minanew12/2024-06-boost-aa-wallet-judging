# Fee-on-transfer tokens are not being accounted for in ManagedBudget disburse process.

## Summary
In the `_transferFungible` function, the contract assumes that the full `amount_` specified will be received by the recipient. However, for fee-on-transfer tokens, the actual amount received will be less than the amount sent. This discrepancy is not accounted for, leading to an overestimation of the distributed amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in the README the protocol does expect interact with all weird ERC20s including USDT. 
Looking at the `_transferFungible` function, fee-on-transfer tokens are clearly not being accounted for.
```solidity
function _transferFungible(address asset_, address to_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual nonReentrant {
        // Increment the total amount of the asset distributed from the budget
        if (to_ == address(0)) revert TransferFailed(asset_, to_, amount_);
        if (amount_ > available(asset_)) {
            revert InsufficientFunds(asset_, available(asset_), amount_);
        }

        _distributedFungible[asset_] += amount_; // < @audit

        // Transfer the asset to the recipient
        if (asset_ == address(0)) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(to_, amount_);
        } else {
            asset_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_);
        }

        emit Distributed(asset_, to_, amount_);
    }
```
The issue in the above function is significant since the function is used in the `disburse` function. Thus when the admin of the ManageBudget disburses an asset that is ERC20 fee-on-transfer token, then there is incorrect accounting of the distributed assets i.e `_distributedFungible[asset_] += amount_` 

## PoC
1. Admin allocates ERC20 fee-on-transfer assets (such as USDT, PAXG, RFI) to the budget. Say the amount is 1000. and the fee on transfer is 5%.
2. The admin calls `disburse` to transfer the assets to the recipient. 
3. The actual transferred amount is 950 due to the 5% fee. But the `_distributedFungible[asset_]` is incremented to 1000. which is WRONG.
 
## Impact
The contract will overestimate the amount of tokens distributed. thus the value of `_distributedFungible[asset_]` will be incorrect causing all functions that rely on it to return wrong values. Such functions are `total(address asset_)` and `distributed(address asset_)`

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For AssetType ERC20, Implement a balance check before and after the transfer.
```solidity
function _transferFungible(address asset_, address to_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual nonReentrant {
// ...
    uint256 balanceBefore = asset_.balanceOf(to_);
    asset_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_);
    uint256 balanceAfter = asset_.balanceOf(to_);
    uint256 actualTransferred = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
    _distributedFungible[asset_] += actualTransferred;
//...
```
