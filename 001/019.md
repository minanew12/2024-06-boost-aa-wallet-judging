# Inability to Handle Fee-on-Transfer Tokens in Budget Allocation

### Summary

The contract assumes that the full amount of tokens specified in a transfer will be received, without accounting for potential fees applied by non-standard ERC-20 tokens. This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) when attempting to deposit fee-on-transfer (FOT) tokens into the budget.

According to the contest's README, the system is designed to support any ERC-20 token, including non-standard or "weird" ones, without requiring token whitelisting.

### Root Cause

In the `allocate`  function, the following comparison is made:

```solidity
          request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
```

If the asset applies a transfer fee, the budget will only receive payload.amount - fee. As a result, for the first deposit, the condition `request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount` will always evaluate to true, since the full `payload.amount` is never received due to the fee deduction, causing the transaction to revert.

### Impact

Denial of Service (DoS) for FOT tokens : Any deposit using a token that applies a fee during transfer will revert, preventing users from depositing such tokens into the budget. This is particularly problematic because the contract is expected to support a wide range of ERC-20 tokens, including non-standard ones.


### Mitigation

Instead of assuming the full `payload.amount` will be received, compare the contractâ€™s balance before and after the transfer to account for any fees or burns. This way, you can accurately determine how many tokens were actually transferred.
