# BoostCore.sol: _routeClaimFee might send all fees to the referrer

### Summary

[BoostCore.sol::_routeClaimFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L305-L319) is called when claiming an incentive. The function handles distribution of the collected fees. It first sends the referral fees to the referrer and afterwards the protocol fee shares to the owner and the protocol fee receiver. As there is no check for the `boost.referralFee`, it is possible to assignee 100% of the fees to the referrer and avoid paying a protocol fee.

### Root Cause

The creator of a boost can set a `protocolFee` and a `referralFee` when creating a new Boost [see](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L121-L122). As there are no checks for either of the fees, its possible to se the `referralFee` to 100%.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Assume protocol X wants to use a Boost but not pay a fee to boost:
1. X sets referral fee to 100%
2. X suggests/makes users send claims with referrer set to a address owned by X

### Impact

Boost will not get any fees from claims.

### PoC

Consider `_routeClaimFee` is called with an amount of 0.01 ETH and `boost.referralFee == FEE_DENOMINATOR`. `referralShare` is set to the initial 0.01 ETH and that amount is send to the referrer. `netFee` is updated to 0 and the `boost.owner` and `protocolFeeReceiver` dont get any fees transferred.

### Mitigation

Add a check to `createBoost` to validate that the sum of both fees is the same as `FEE_DENOMINATOR` to make sure all fees are distributed as intended:
