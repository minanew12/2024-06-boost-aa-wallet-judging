# In `BoostCore` the protocol will get more or less than the intended percentage of the `ClaimFee`

## Summary
By default, the protocol is not supposed to get less than 10% of the claim fee of `0.000075` ether and this percentage can be increased by the Boost creator to a value between 10% - 100%. But the implementation of `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` makes it that the protocol receives more or less than the intended percentage. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimFee` is supposed to be divided between the boost owner, referrer and the protocol. The percentages of the referrer and the protocol are specified during the boost's creation but must not be lower than 10%.

```Solidity
    /// @notice The base protocol fee (in bps)
    uint64 public protocolFee = 1_000; // 10%

    /// @notice The base referral fee (in bps)
    uint64 public referralFee = 1_000; // 10%
```

Boost creators can increase these percentages during Boost creation.

```Solidity
        boost.protocolFee = protocolFee + payload_.protocolFee;
        boost.referralFee = referralFee + payload_.referralFee;
```
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L121C1-L122C64


But when distributing the fees during a claim in `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` the protocol's percentage is not followed as it is divided by 2 on the remaining value after deducting the referrer's fees.

```Solidity

        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = (claimFee * boost.referralFee) /
                FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
        protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);

```

## Proof of concept 
Let's consider two scenarios:
Scenario A:
     Boost.protocalFee = 5000(50%)
     Boost.referralFee = 1000(10%)

    In this case when the `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` divides the fee every one gets:
     Protocal gets 0.00003375 ether
     Refferal gets 0.0000075 ether
     BoostOwnwer gets 0.00003375 ether

    The real amounts they were supposed to receive based on the percentages:
      Protocal should get 0.0000375 ether
      Refferal should get 0.00000075 ether
      BoostOwnwer should get 0.00003 ether  

    Here the protocal loses 0.00000375 ether while the owner gets 0.00000375 ether more than he should.


Scenario B:
     Boost.protocalFee = 3000(30%)
     Boost.referralFee = 1000(10%)

    In this case when the `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` divides the fee every one gets:
     Protocal = 0.000037125 ether
     Refferal = 0.00000075 ether
     BoostOwnwer = 0.000037125 ether

    The real amounts they were supposed to receive based on the percentages:
      Protocal should get 0.0000225 ether
      Refferal should get 0.00000075 ether
      BoostOwnwer should get 0.000045 ether  

    Here the Boost owner loses 0.0000014625 ether while the protocol gets 0.0000014625 ether more he should.


## Impact
  Loss of fees to both owner and the protocol due to the unfollowed percentage distribution specified during initialization.

## Recommendation
 Implement the `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` in such a way that it follows the given percentages whereby each party receives the intended amount.
