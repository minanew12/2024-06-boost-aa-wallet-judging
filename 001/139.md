# Allocate not to spec and can drain funders

## Summary
Anyone can call the `allocate` function of `ManagedBudget` to deposit funds into the contract. However, the target for the asset transfer can be specified, and does not need to be the caller. As a result, the function is not to spec and any funders of the budget are at a high risk of losing funds.  

## Vulnerability Detail
The `allocate` function of `ManagedBudget` is used to fund budgets for use in the various incentives of boosts. In particular, callers can fund the budget with ERC20 and ERC1155 assets:

```solidity
    /// @dev The caller must have already approved the contract to transfer the asset
    function allocate(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool) {
...
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));


            // Transfer `payload.amount` of the token to this contract
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
            ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));


            // Transfer `payload.amount` of `payload.tokenId` to this contract
            IERC1155(request.asset).safeTransferFrom(
                request.target, address(this), payload.tokenId, payload.amount, payload.data
            );
            if (IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
```

Crucially, the `from` field of the `safeTransferFrom` functions does not use the caller's address, but allows the caller to specify an arbitrary target to pull assets from.

## Impact
This function is not to spec since the caller does not necessarily need to transfer his own assets (can transfer other people's assets instead) while the existing comment indicates `the caller must have already approved the contract to transfer the asset`. 

Additionally anyone can call `allocate` to drain the balance of another user who approved this contract. For example, perhaps the funder has transferred some tokens in the past and has a remaining approval which is abused. Since anyone can fund this contract, the funders may not necessarily be the same trusted role in charge of disbursements of funds and thus would not have access to call `disburse` or `clawback`, losing these funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rather than using `request.target` for the `from` field of `safeTransferFrom`, consider using `msg.sender`.
