# claimFees are not tracked properly in BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor

### Summary

The claimFee [validation check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L172) in `BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor` allows the user to send msg.value greater than claim fee but the protocol does not track the claimFee well to be able to distribute the fee properly according to natspec and as a result all the excess fees are sent to `protocolFeeReceiver`.

### Root Cause

in BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor, This [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L172) does not handle cases where msg.value is greater than claimFee and as a result keeps `claimFee` out of sync with the amount of eth sent 

### Internal pre-conditions

No pre-con

### External pre-conditions

No pre-con

### Attack Path

Caller needs to call BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor or BoostCore::claimIncentive with eth greater than claimFee

### Impact

Extra/Excess claim fees will be sent to `protocolFeeReceiver` instead of sharing it as per the [invariant](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L309-L316) stated in the contract

### PoC

from the code below
```solidity
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        //@audit if user sends more than claimFee it will be sent to the protocol receiver making him get more he supposed to be allocated
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);


        if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```

after the audit tag we can confirm that the check allows users to pay more than claim fee

after user pays, the `_routeClaimFee` below is used to route the fee to the respective beneficiaries

```solidity
    function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
@-->        protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
    }
```

we can see the router doesn't track the msg.value sent properly as a result the claimFee used for computaion will allocate wrong amounts to beneficiaries i.e prorocol Fee Receiver takes the excess fees meanwhile it is supposed to be half of the original 

you can run this test to confirm 

first change _routeClaimFee from internal to external payable then change boost param from storage to memory

then add this test to BoostCore.t.sol

```solidity
    function testRouteFee() public {
        BoostLib.Boost memory boost = boostCore.createBoost(validCreateCalldata);
        boostCore._routeClaimFee{value:1 ether}(boost,address(1));
    }
```

from the 3 fallbacks in the test results you'll see the protocolFeeReceiver takes all the excess which violates the invariant stated in the natspec



### Mitigation


Protocol can change the if statement this way to prevent sending eth greater than or less than claimfee

```diff
 function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];

-        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
+        if (msg.value != claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```
