# Incorrect calculation of protocol fee in `BoostCore::_routerClaim`

## Summary
Instead of using the protocol fee that was set for that particular boost while creating it in `BoostCore::createBoost` a wrong calculated fee is been sent to `protocolFeeReceiver` in function `BoostCore::_routerClaim`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When a `Boost` is created through `BoostCore::createBoost` at that time `protocolFee` and `referralFee` is been set in order to correctly take the portion of `claimFee` when it is distributed.
```solidity 
@>      boost.protocolFee = protocolFee + payload_.protocolFee;
@>      boost.referralFee = referralFee + payload_.referralFee;
```
Now when a user claims his incentive from `BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor` at that time, he sends the `claimFee` in the contract, which then is distributed in between the owner, referrer and protocol fee receiver:

```solidity
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
@>      if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
@>      _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, function is nonReentrant)
        if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```
Now Let's look how the distribution of claim fee in between the owner, referrer and protocol fee receiver in function `_routeClaimFee` is happening and why it is wrong

```solidity
    function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
@>      uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
@>          uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
@>      boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
@>      protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
    }

```
Now in the above calculation, we can clearly notice that no `boost.protocolFee` is been used in order to calculate the fee for `protocolFeeReceiver`, and directly the the `netFee` is getting slit out in half and is been sent `owner` and the remaining half sent to `protocolFeeReceiver` which is absolutely incorrect.

## Impact
More fees than accepted have been sent to `protocolFeeReceiver` , which also means that less fees than `accepted` is been sent to `owner`. 
To prove my above impact statement, I've done a simple math with a simple example in PoC, please consider checking it. 

## Proof of Concept:
In bps system 1500 is 15% as we know, 1 basis point (bps) = 0.01%
Setting example values in bps: 
boost.protocolFee: 1500
boost.referralFee: 1500

The above both values are set to 15%, meaning 15% of `claimFee` should be sent to each of them, and reaming 70% to `owner` but actually code this is not happening:

Now in `_routeClaimFee` calculation, according to code => 
15% of `claimFee` is sent to `referrer_` which is correct.

Now similarly 15% of `claimFee` should be sent to `protocolFeeReceiver` as well, but here in code a slit of half of reaming 85% of`claimFee` is been sent. Which absolutely incorrect as now a total of  
45% of `claimFee` is been sent, which should have been only 15% of `claimFee`.

And `owner` should have received the remaining fees of (100% - 15% - 15%) = 70% of `claimFee` but here in this case in reality he is only receiving 45% of `claimFee`. Which again inaccurate and leading a loss for `owner` address. 

Now total 85%(100-15) of initial `claimFee` is reaming in contract, which is

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The right calculation of the fee should have been like this ->

```diff
    function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

-          boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
-          protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);

         // ex - 20% of claimFee
+        uint256 protocolFees = claimFee * boost.protocolFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR; 
+        netFee -= protocolFees;
+        protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(protocolFees);

        // now send the remaining fee to the owner (which will be netFee, as we have subtracted both amounts of fees from the claimFee)
+        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee);

}
```
