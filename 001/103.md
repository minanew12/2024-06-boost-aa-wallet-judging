# An attacker can give invalid address as referrer address for users to claim reward causing denial of service (DoS) to those users.

### Summary

An attacker can invite users and give them an invalid address or an address of contract that cannot receive ether as referrer address. Every user that use the referrer address to claim incentives will have their transactions fail. 


### Root Cause

`BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` reverts if the ether transfer to referrer address fails.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An attacker advertises his (invalid) referrer address for platform users to use;
2. Users include the referrer address in the input for `BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor` to claim incentives but the transactions will revert.

### Impact

Denial of services to incentive claimers and loss of gas fees due to failed transactions.

### PoC

A simple contract called `RevertEth` was created to generate PoC. `RevertEth` does not receive ether as shown below.

please create a file for the `RevertEth` contract in evm folder.  Copy the test below into BoostCore.t.sol and run it. 


```solidity
// ----- RevertEth.sol------
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
contract RevertEth is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("RevertEth", "NOETH") {}

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
    receive() external payable {
        revert();
    }
}

   function testClaimIncentive_WithReferrer_Audit() public {
        // Create a Boost first
        boostCore.createBoost(validCreateCalldata);

        // Mint an ERC721 token to the claimant (this contract)
        uint256 tokenId = 1;
        mockERC721.mint{value: 0.1 ether}(address(this));
        mockERC721.mint{value: 0.1 ether}(address(this));
        mockERC721.mint{value: 0.1 ether}(address(this));

        // Define a referrer
        address referrer = address(new RevertEth());
        // vm.deal(referrer, 1 ether); // Fund the referrer for testing purposes

        // Prepare the data payload for validation
        bytes memory data = abi.encode(address(this), abi.encode(tokenId));
        // Claim the incentive with a referrer
        vm.expectRevert();
        boostCore.claimIncentive{value: 0.000075 ether}(0, 0, referrer, data);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Refactor `BoostCore::_routeClaimFee` as below.

```solidity
    function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
-           referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
+           try referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare) {} catch {
+               netFee = claimFee;
+           }
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
        protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
    }
```
