# ManagedBudget lack of request.target input validation leads to loss of fund

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In ManagedBudge allocate function,

```solidity
  function allocate(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual override returns (bool) {
        Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
        if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));

            // Ensure the value received is equal to the `payload.amount`
            if (msg.value != payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
            FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));
            request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
            if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
            ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));

            // Transfer `payload.amount` of `payload.tokenId` to this contract
            IERC1155(request.asset).safeTransferFrom(
                request.target, address(this), payload.tokenId, payload.amount, payload.data
            );
            if (IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
        } else {
            // Unsupported asset type
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
```

this function has no access control and as long as the request.target has sufficient allowance, anyone can steal the fund and move the fund from the request.target  address to the ManagedBudget contract by triggering

```solidity
  request.asset.safeTransferFrom(request.target, address(this), payload.amount);
```

## Impact

loss of fund when use managed budget and user lose all the token (fund rest in the wallet as long as the wallet has allowance.)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

do not user input the request.target address directly and add the onlyOwner modifier to this function allocate.
