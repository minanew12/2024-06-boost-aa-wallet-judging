# Incompatibility with Fee-on-Transfer Tokens Causes Transaction Reverts

## Summary
The protocol claims to support all tokens, including unusual ones, but fails to handle Fee-on-Transfer (FoT) tokens. This leads to transaction reverts when using FoT tokens in allocation and reward transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail
Readme states that all the tokens are supported including the weird tokens

The protocolâ€™s `allocate()` function performs balance checks that revert when a Fee-on-Transfer token sends less than expected due to the fee deducted during transfers:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L81

```solidity
if (IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
```

Hence when user transfer the tokens from the account to the address using `FungiblePayload` as the amount and because of fee on transfer the contract will receive less than expected hence the check will fail and revert and hence will not be able to transfer the tokens.

An option to bypass this check is to send tokens directly to the contract address.

But when the funds move from budget to the incentive, again incentive contract will receive fewer tokens than expected and again will revert because of the following check 

```solidity             
if (available < maxTotalReward) { 
            revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, maxTotalReward);
        }
```

Since Fee-on-Transfer tokens deduct a percentage of the amount transferred, the protocol's balance checks fail, preventing the proper functioning of the transfers.

## Impact
The protocol becomes unusable for Fee-on-Transfer tokens, causing unexpected reverts during allocations and reward transfers. This could prevent users from interacting with the protocol effectively when using such tokens.
