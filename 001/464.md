# ETH Locked in Budget Contract in the protocol

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/SimpleBudget.sol#L108

in the line:

```solidity
Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
    if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH || request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
        FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));
        _transferFungible(
            request.asset, request.target, payload.amount == 0 ? available(request.asset) : payload.amount
        );
    } else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
        ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));
        _transferERC1155(
            request.asset,
            request.target,
            payload.tokenId,
            payload.amount == 0 ? IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) : payload.amount,
            payload.data
        );
    }
```


The bug is that the code doesn't handle the case where `request.assetType` is `AssetType.ETH` differently from `AssetType.ERC20`. 

For ETH transfers, we shouldn't be using `_transferFungible` because ETH is not an ERC20 token and doesn't have a `balanceOf` function. Instead, we should be using a direct ETH transfer.

Here's how the code should be structured to handle this case:

```solidity
Transfer memory request = abi.decode(data_, (Transfer));
if (request.assetType == AssetType.ETH) {
    FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));
    uint256 amount = payload.amount == 0 ? address(this).balance : payload.amount;
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(request.target, amount);
    emit Distributed(address(0), request.target, amount);
} else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC20) {
    FungiblePayload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (FungiblePayload));
    _transferFungible(
        request.asset, request.target, payload.amount == 0 ? available(request.asset) : payload.amount
    );
} else if (request.assetType == AssetType.ERC1155) {
    ERC1155Payload memory payload = abi.decode(request.data, (ERC1155Payload));
    _transferERC1155(
        request.asset,
        request.target,
        payload.tokenId,
        payload.amount == 0 ? IERC1155(request.asset).balanceOf(address(this), payload.tokenId) : payload.amount,
        payload.data
    );
} else {
    revert("Unsupported asset type");
}
```

This modification ensures that ETH transfers are handled correctly, separately from ERC20 token transfers. It uses `SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH` for ETH transfers, which is the appropriate method for sending ETH. This is crucial for the proper functioning of the budget system in the Boost protocol, especially when dealing with native ETH transfers.


The bug is in the `clawback` function of the `ManagedBudget` contract. This function is crucial because it allows admins to reclaim assets from the budget, which is an important safety mechanism.

The issue arises because the function doesn't properly handle ETH (native currency) clawbacks. While it correctly distinguishes between ETH and ERC20 tokens in the condition, it treats them the same in the execution, which is incorrect.

#### Here's why this is problematic:

1. For ERC20 tokens, using `_transferFungible` is correct because it calls the token's `transfer` function.
2. For ETH, however, `_transferFungible` would fail because there's no `transfer` function for ETH.

#### Impact and PoC flow:

1. An admin tries to clawback ETH from the budget.
2. They call `clawback` with `AssetType.ETH`.
3. The function incorrectly tries to use `_transferFungible` for ETH.
4. The transaction reverts due to the missing `transfer` function for ETH.
5. As a result, admins cannot reclaim ETH from the budget, effectively locking it in the contract.

#### This bug could have severe consequences:

1. Loss of funds: If ETH is sent to the budget (which is possible via the `allocate` function), it becomes unrecoverable through the intended `clawback` mechanism.
2. Broken functionality: The ability to reclaim assets is a core feature of the budget system in the Boost protocol. Its failure for ETH undermines the contract's purpose.
3. Inconsistent behavior: The contract behaves differently for ETH and ERC20 tokens, which could lead to confusion and potential exploitation.

PoC Example:

```solidity
// Assume the budget has 1 ETH

// Admin tries to clawback 0.5 ETH
bytes memory clawbackData = abi.encode(
    ABudget.Transfer({
        assetType: ABudget.AssetType.ETH,
        asset: address(0),
        target: admin,
        data: abi.encode(ABudget.FungiblePayload({amount: 0.5 ether}))
    })
);

// This call will revert
budget.clawback(clawbackData);

// The ETH remains locked in the contract
assert(address(budget).balance == 1 ether);
```
