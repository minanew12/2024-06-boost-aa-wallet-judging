# Burn token will not decrease supply

### Summary

The [`Points`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/tokens/Points.sol) contract is a soulbound token. It means that the token can't be transfer and can be only mint or burn. When burning the token, the total supply does not decrease.

### Root Cause

To burn a token, the user has to call the transfer function as explained in [the comments](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/tokens/Points.sol#L52-L54):

```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc ERC20
    /// @notice A hook that is called before any transfer of points
    /// @dev Reverts if the transfer is not a mint or burn (i.e. if neither `from` nor `to` are the zero address)
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256) internal virtual override {
        if (from != address(0) && to != address(0)) revert NonTransferable();
    }
```

So any user calling the transfer function can transfer his token to the `address(0)`. But when doing so, it does not decrease the `totalsupply` variable. Then, any protocol or user calling the `totalSupply()` function will have the wrong value.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user have one token and choose to burn it.
2. He transfers his token to `address(0)` because it is the only way to do so.
3. An other user call the `totalSupply()` function. The result is false.

### Impact

Any protocol using this token can't use the `totalSupply()` function since it returns false value. Note that a soulbound token can't be transfer, so when the user transfer to `address(0)`, it must decrease the total supply variable as when there is a burn.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a `burn` function and revert transfer to `address(0)`.
