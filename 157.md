# Assumption about _makeIncentives in createBoost function

## Summary
`BoostCore::createBoost` function assumes that `_makeIncentives` always succeeds without reverting.
## Vulnerability Detail
`BoostCore::createBoost` function assumes that `_makeIncentives` always succeeds without reverting, potentially leading to inconsistent state, incomplete initialization and gas waste. Errors are also not propagated to the caller.
## Impact
 If `_makeIncentives` reverts, the function will continue execution without addressing the issue, leading to unpredictable behavior in state, and if it reverts after partial initialization, gas is wasted on operations that won't be completed. 
Lack of error propagation, making debugging difficult.

**Since the `_makeIncentives` plays a critical role in setting up the incentives. Its importance lies in its ability to create a secure, flexible, and scalable system for managing incentives within the Boost protocol. An issue could potentially compromise the entire Boost creation process and the incentives themselves.**

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1.Use a try-catch block to handle incentive creation attempts.
```javascript
try BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts.push();
    // ... rest of the function ...
catch Error(string memory reason) {
    revert BoostError.IncentiveCreationFailed(reason);
}
```
2. Modify `_makeIncentives` to propagate errors up the call stack.
3. Consider adding checks within `_makeIncentives` to prevent double initialization or other potential issues.
4. Review the overall architecture to ensure that partial failures in incentive creation don't compromise the integrity of the Boost.

These ensure that all failures are caught and handled, the function doesn't silently ignore failures and the caller receives the complete status of all incentives.
