# Lack of Access Control in `BoostRegistry::register` and `BoostRegistry::deployClone` Functions Allowing Unauthorized Registrations and Deployments


## Summary
The `BoostRegistry::register` and `BoostRegistry::deployClone` functions do not enforce sufficient access control, allowing any user to invoke them. This could result in unauthorized users registering malicious contracts or deploying harmful clones. The lack of restrictions opens the protocol to potential abuse and exploitation, which could affect the integrity and security of the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions `BoostRegistry::register` and `BoostRegistry::deployClone` can be called by any external user without any access control mechanisms such as role checks or restrictions. This allows unauthorized users to register malicious base implementations or deploy harmful contract clones. Malicious actors could exploit this to introduce unauthorized contracts into the registry, bypassing the intended security mechanisms, and affecting the entire protocol.

- The `BoostRegistry::register` function allows any user to register new base implementations, which could result in trusted components interacting with unverified or malicious contracts.
- The `BoostRegistry::deployClone` function similarly allows any user to deploy clones of base implementations without proper validation, potentially leading to the deployment of harmful clones.

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to the following impacts:
- **Severe financial loss**: Malicious contracts could be introduced into the system, interacting with trusted contracts and stealing funds or manipulating data.
- **Operational disruption**: Unauthorized clones could cause unintended interactions, halting operations, or degrading the performance of the protocol.
- **Protocol integrity**: The overall security of the protocol could be compromised, leading to a loss of trust among users and potential protocol-wide exploits.

## Tool Used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
Include mechanisms to ensure that base implementations and clones are validated before being added or deployed to prevent the introduction of malicious contracts.
