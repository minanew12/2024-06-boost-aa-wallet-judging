# Lack of Access Control on Registration

## Summary

The `register` function is `external` and can be called by any address. There is no access control mechanism (e.g., `onlyOwner` or role-based access) to restrict who can register new base implementations.

## Vulnerability Detail

An attacker can register a malicious base implementation that conforms to the `ACloneable` interface but contains harmful code.

An attacker could register implementations with commonly used names, preventing legitimate users from registering their implementations due to the `AlreadyRegistered` error.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict the `register` function to authorized users only. This can be achieved using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` or `AccessControl` contracts.
