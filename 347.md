# Users can end up with less rewards than they expect or no rewards from incentives due to frontrunning

## Summary
After users perform the actions required by the boosts, their claims might get no rewards due to several reasons, these can be hitting claim limits in ERC or depletion of rewards in both ERC and CGDA incentives.
## Vulnerability Detail
After users complete the required actions, they will get a signature from the backend which they will use to claim incentives. The issue is that users might get frontrun by other users who generated signatures and sit on them, this can lead to users getting much less than what they expect from CGDA incentives, and nothing at all from ERC incentives.

For brevity, only ERC1155 limit functionality is included in the report:

```solidity
    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        // Disburse the incentive based on the strategy (POOL only for now)
        if (strategy == Strategy.POOL) {
            if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();

            claims++;
            claimed[claimTarget] = true;

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (not a risk here)
            asset.safeTransferFrom(address(this), claimTarget, tokenId, 1, data_);
            emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, tokenId, uint256(1), data_));

            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

    function _isClaimable(address recipient_) internal view returns (bool) {
        return !claimed[recipient_] && claims < limit;
    }
```
Also note that for CGDA incentives the transactions will go through and mark the signatures as [used](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L85C1-L100) due to how reward decaying works.
## Impact
Users can end up with less rewards than they expect.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As signature generation and claiming have to stay decoupled, a way to lower the odds of exploitation is to add expiration to signatures. Another way of fortification could be the backend submitting the signature on behalf of users.
