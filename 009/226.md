# Precision Loss Due to Hardcoded Decimals During Reward Calculation


## Summary
The `ERC20VariableIncentive::claim` function calculates reward amounts using hardcoded decimal places (1e18) without accounting for the actual decimals of the token being used. This can lead to precision loss for tokens with fewer or more than 18 decimals, such as USDT (which has 6 decimals). As a result, reward amounts may be miscalculated, leading to potential loss of value or unexpected behavior.


## Vulnerability Detail

The code divides reward amounts by 1e18 under the assumption that the token being used has 18 decimals, like ETH. However, not all tokens have 18 decimals. For example, USDT has only 6 decimals, meaning that the calculation will be off by a factor of 1e12, causing incorrect reward values.
If a token like USDT with 6 decimals is used, this calculation would result in precision loss, and the claim amount would be incorrect. This could lead to underpaying or overpaying incentives.

## Impact
For tokens with fewer than 18 decimals, this could result in significant underpayment or overpayment of rewards. For instance, if a token has 6 decimals (like USDT), this discrepancy could lead to users receiving only a fraction of the correct reward, leading to financial losses or imbalances in reward distribution.


## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20VariableIncentive.sol#L62
```javascript
function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        BoostClaimData memory boostClaimData = abi.decode(data_, (BoostClaimData));
        uint256 signedAmount = abi.decode(boostClaimData.incentiveData, (uint256));
        uint256 claimAmount;
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();

        if (reward == 0) {
            claimAmount = signedAmount;
        } else {
            // NOTE: this is assuming that the signed scalar is in ETH decimal format
 @>>>           claimAmount = reward * signedAmount / 1e18;
        }

        if (totalClaimed + claimAmount > limit) revert ClaimFailed();

        totalClaimed += claimAmount;
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, claimAmount);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, claimAmount));
        return true;
    }

```
## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To avoid precision loss, the calculation should account for the tokenâ€™s actual number of decimals. The correct approach would be to fetch the token's decimals dynamically and adjust the reward calculation accordingly, as shown below:

```diff
   function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        BoostClaimData memory boostClaimData = abi.decode(data_, (BoostClaimData));
        uint256 signedAmount = abi.decode(boostClaimData.incentiveData, (uint256));
        uint256 claimAmount;
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();

        if (reward == 0) {
            claimAmount = signedAmount;
        } else {
            // NOTE: this is assuming that the signed scalar is in ETH decimal format
+             uint8 tokenDecimals = IERC20(asset).decimals();  // Fetch the correct decimal places
+ claimAmount = reward * signedAmount / (10 ** tokenDecimals);  // Correctly account for the token's decimals

-            claimAmount = reward * signedAmount / 1e18;
        }

        if (totalClaimed + claimAmount > limit) revert ClaimFailed();

        totalClaimed += claimAmount;
        asset.safeTransfer(claimTarget, claimAmount);

        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, claimAmount));
        return true;
    }
```
