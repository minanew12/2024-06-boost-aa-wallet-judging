# Incorrect Reward Calculation Due to Hardcoded Decimal Assumption for ERC-20 Tokens

## Summary
The `ERC20VariableIncentive` contract assumes that the reward calculation is based on tokens with 18 decimal places (such as ETH), which may lead to incorrect reward distribution when dealing with tokens that use different decimal formats, such as USDT or USDC, which have 6 decimal places. This discrepancy can result in the wrong `claimAmount` being transferred to users.

## Vulnerability Detail
The reward calculation in the `claim` function is based on a hardcoded assumption of 18 decimal places (`1e18`), which is not applicable to all ERC-20 tokens. For tokens like USDT and USDC, which use 6 decimal places, the calculation results in an incorrect incentive amount.

### Code Snippet: Vulnerable Reward Calculation

```solidity
    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        BoostClaimData memory boostClaimData = abi.decode(data_, (BoostClaimData));
        uint256 signedAmount = abi.decode(boostClaimData.incentiveData, (uint256));
        uint256 claimAmount;
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();

        if (reward == 0) {
            claimAmount = signedAmount;
        } else {
            // NOTE: this is assuming that the signed scalar is in ETH decimal format
ðŸ‘‰          claimAmount = reward * signedAmount / 1e18;
        }
```

Here, the contract uses a fixed value of `1e18` to calculate the claimable reward amount. This calculation will be incorrect for tokens like USDT and USDC, which use 6 decimal places. It can lead to users receiving significantly less or more than they should, depending on the token's decimal structure.

## Impact
The use of a hardcoded `1e18` value for reward calculation results in incorrect payouts when non-standard tokens (e.g., USDC or USDT) are used. This can cause financial discrepancies, potentially overpaying or underpaying users based on the tokenâ€™s actual decimal format.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the reward calculation to dynamically retrieve the tokenâ€™s decimals using the `IERC20(asset).decimals()` function instead of relying on a hardcoded `1e18` value. This will ensure that the correct decimal format is used for all ERC-20 tokens, preventing incorrect reward distribution. For example:

```solidity
uint8 decimals = IERC20(asset).decimals();
claimAmount = reward * signedAmount / (10  decimals);
```
