# Incorrect Handling of Signed Amounts for Tokens with Varying Decimal Precision

### Summary

The incentives contract assumes that all signed amounts are in ETH's 18-decimal format, which causes inaccurate claim amounts for tokens with different decimal precisions.


### Root Cause

The signed amount (`signedAmount`) is treated as having 18 decimals, regardless of the reward token's actual decimal precision. The calculation does not adjust for tokens with fewer or more decimals, causing inconsistencies in the claim amounts for non-18-decimal tokens.

```solidity
       if (reward == 0) {
@>          claimAmount = signedAmount ;
        } else {
            // NOTE: this is assuming that the signed scalar is in ETH decimal format
            claimAmount = reward * signedAmount / 1e18;
        }
```

The sponsor confirmed that the signed amount is assumed to always be in decimal 18

### Impact

If the `signedAmount` is in ETH's 18-decimal format and the token has fewer decimals, such as USDC with 6 decimals, the transaction will failed or the contract will be drained (if there is enough balance).

### Mitigation

Adjust the calculation by scaling the `signedAmount` based on the actual token decimal precision using `10**asset.decimals()` to convert it from the 18-decimal format to the token's correct precision.

```solidity
if (reward == 0) {
    // scale values correctly based on the token's decimal precision.
@>  claimAmount = signedAmount * 10**asset.decimals() / 1e18;
} else {
    // we supposed reward is in the right decimal format
    claimAmount = reward * signedAmount / 1e18;
}

```
