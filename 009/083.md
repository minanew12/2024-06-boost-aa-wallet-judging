# Incorrect Reward Calculation for Tokens with Fewer Than 18 Decimals

### Summary

The use of a hardcoded factor `1e18` in the `claimAmount` calculation will cause inaccurate rewards distribution for tokens with fewer than `18 decimals`, leading to potential losses for users who claim rewards.

### Root Cause

`claimAmount = reward * signedAmount / 1e18;`

The root cause is the hardcoded division by `1e18`, which assumes all tokens have `18 decimals`. This will result in inaccurate calculations for tokens with fewer decimals, such as `USDT` or `USDC`, which have `6 decimals`. The system incorrectly scales down the reward for tokens with fewer than `18 decimals`, leading to underpayment or overpayment depending on the context.

### Impact

The affected users suffer from inaccurate reward distribution. In this case, the stakers claiming rewards in tokens with fewer than `18 decimals` (e.g., USDT) will receive incorrect amounts, potentially leading to significant financial discrepancies depending on the token and reward settings. The protocol might underpay or overpay claimants based on the error, resulting in a skewed distribution of rewards.

### PoC

```solidity
function testClaimWith6Decimals() public {
        // Set up the mock 6-decimal token (e.g., USDT)
        MockERC20 mock6DecimalAsset = new MockERC20();
        mock6DecimalAsset.mint(address(this), 10e6);
        
        mock6DecimalAsset.approve(address(incentive), 10e6);
        mock6DecimalAsset.transfer(address(incentive), 5e6);

        // Verify contract's balance before claim
        uint256 contractBalance = mock6DecimalAsset.balanceOf(address(incentive));
        assertEq(contractBalance, 5e6, "Incentive contract should have 5 USDC (5e6)");

        // Initialize the incentive contract with the mock 6-decimal token
        // reward = 1.5 USDT (1.5e6 in 6 decimals), limit = 5 USDT (5e6 in 6 decimals)
        _initialize(address(mock6DecimalAsset), 1.5e6, 5e6); // Initialize with reward and limit in 6 decimals

        // Check that the reward is initialized correctly
        uint256 rewardValue = incentive.reward();
        assertEq(rewardValue, 1.5e6, "Reward should be initialized to 1.5 USDC (1.5e6)");

        // Mock BoostClaimData with a signed amount of 2 USDT (in 6 decimals: 2 * 10^6)
        BoostClaimData memory boostClaimData = BoostClaimData({
            incentiveData: abi.encode(uint256(2e6)) // 2 USDT in 6 decimals
        });

        bytes memory claimData = abi.encode(boostClaimData);

        // Perform the claim without checking for event emission
        bool success = incentive.claim(CLAIM_RECIPIENT, claimData);
        assertTrue(success, "Claim should succeed");

        // Verify that the correct amount was transferred to the recipient
        uint256 expectedClaimAmount = 3e6; // 3 USDT in 6 decimals (1.5 * 2 = 3 USDT)
        uint256 actualClaimAmount = mock6DecimalAsset.balanceOf(CLAIM_RECIPIENT);
        assertEq(actualClaimAmount, expectedClaimAmount, "Claimed amount should be 3 USDT");

        // Verify the state in the contract, e.g., totalClaimed should increase by the claim amount
        uint256 totalClaimed = incentive.totalClaimed();
        assertEq(totalClaimed, expectedClaimAmount, "Total claimed should be updated to 3 USDT");
    }
```
```solidity
[FAIL. Reason: Claimed amount should be 3 USDT: 0 != 3000000]
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, modify the `claimAmount` calculation to account for the token's decimal places dynamically
