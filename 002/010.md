# Wrong owner initialization in incentive contracts will cause owner functions to be unusable

### Summary

Wrong owner initialization in incentive contracts will cause owner functions to be unusable.

### Root Cause

When a user creates a boost, they supplies the base implementations of the incentive contract, and then the incentive contracts are cloned and initialized in the `BoostCore#_makeIncentives` function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L266

```solidity
    function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
        internal
        returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
    {
        incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
            // Deploy the clone, but don't initialize until it we've preflighted
            _checkTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);

            // Ensure the target is a base implementation (incentive clones are not reusable)
            if (!targets_[i].isBase) {
                revert BoostError.InvalidInstance(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);
            }

>>          incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], false));

            bytes memory preflight = incentives[i].preflight(targets_[i].parameters);
            if (preflight.length != 0) {
                // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
                assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
            }

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
>>          incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
        }
    }
```

The incentive contracts are in scope: [AllowListIncentive.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/AllowListIncentive.sol), [CGDAIncentive.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol), [ERC1155Incentive.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC1155Incentive.sol), [ERC20Incentive.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol), [ERC20VariableIncentive.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20VariableIncentive.sol), [PointsIncentive.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/PointsIncentive.sol).

In the `initialize` function of all these incentive contracts, the contract's owner is initialized to `msg.sender`, which is the `BoostCore` contract.

Because the `BoostCore` contract can not transfer ownership back to the user, all the owner functions of the incentive contract can only be executed by the `BoostCore` contract.

In case of the `IncentiveContract#claim` function, it is expected that only the `BoostCore` contract can call to this function. However, other owner functions such as: `clawback`, `drawRaffle` are not expected to be called by the `BoostCore` contract, but rather for the boost creator to use.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

A user create a boost.

### Impact

Since the `BoostCore` contract can only call to the `claim` function, all the other owner functions of the incentive contract are unusable:
- The `clawback` function in `CGDAIncentive`, `ERC1155Incentive`, `ERC20Incentive`, `ERC20VariableIncentive` is unusable.
- The `drawRaffle` function `ERC20Incentive` is unusable. For the `ERC20Incentive`, when the strategy is `Strategy.RAFFLE`, the `claim` function is used to add the `claimTarget` to the `entries` array. When the `drawRaffle` function is called, a winner will be selected, and then the rewards are sent to the winner. Since the `drawRaffle` function is unusable, a winner can not be selected. Moreover since the  `clawback` function is unusable, the boost creator can not reclaim the rewards back, the rewards will be stuck in the `ERC20Incentive` and lost forever.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add a manager role for the incentive contract.
- Set the manager role for the boost creator in the `initialize` function.
- The manager can execute `clawback` and `drawRaffle` function in the incentive contract.
