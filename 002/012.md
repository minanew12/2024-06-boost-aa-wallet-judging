# Inability to claim from Raffle based ERC20 Incentive will permanently lock funds.

### Summary

In `RAFFLE` strategy based `ERC20Incentive` - users that claimed can win the rewards based on a raffle.
However the raffle operation `drawRaffle` has an `onlyOwner` modifier that prevents anyone other then `BoostCore` to call it. 

`BoostCore` does not have the ability to call `drawRaffle`. Therefore, the rewards are stuck in the incentive contract - both users that claimed and boost owner cannot withdraw them.

### Root Cause

in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L25 there is no option to call `drawRaffle`

### Internal pre-conditions

1.  The `ERC20Incentive` needs to be configured in `RAFFLE` mode. 

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User creates boosts
2. Users perform actions and claim
3. Raffle cannot be called - users cannot get rewards for their actions. 

### Impact

- The entire rewards in the incentive is permanently locked. 
- Users will not receive rewards for their actions
- Boost owner cannot withdraw stuck funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding `drawRaffle` to the `BoostCore`.
