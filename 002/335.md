# Weak PRNG will allow a malicious actor to MEV the `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle` function

### Summary

In `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle` the raffle winner gets determined by solady's `LibPRNG` using `block.prevrandao` value.  `block.prevrandao` is **inefficient** for getting a random value due to the fact that it returns a uint256 value from the previous **randao** value from the latest published block available on chain. The malicious user can **take advantage** of this to determine whether they would be a winner **if** they participated in the lottery, and therefore frontrun the `drawRaffle` transaction and join **just before** the winner is drawn.

### Root Cause

In [drawRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L140) function the random number is retrieved by using `block.prevrandao` + `block.timestamp` where both of the values are **onchain** and can just be **retrieved** by the malicious actor.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Boost has been created with its incentive being `ERC20Incentive`
2. Users have participated in the `raffle` by *claiming* their **participation**

### External pre-conditions

1. Malicious actor is tracking the `mempool` for a transaction that calls the `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle`
2. The malicious actor has performed the action specified in the `Boost`

### Attack Path

1. Boost has been created with its incentive being `ERC20Incentive` and users have participated in the raffle
2. The malicious actor has performed the action specified in the `Boost` and is tracking the `mempool` for a transaction that calls the `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle`
3. The transaction gets casted to the `mempool` and the malicious actor retrieves the random number the same way that has been retrieved in the `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle` function
4. The malicious actor does the following calculations: `uint256 index = _prng.next() % entries.length + 1`
5. If the index for the `entries` array is the **last index** then the malicious actor **frontruns** the execution of `drawRaffle()` end their address becomes the **last entry** in the `entries` array, thus they become the winner of the raffle. 

### Impact

This issue disrupts the workflow of the protocol because of the ability to easily **guess** the random number the protocol is using to determine the raffle winner
