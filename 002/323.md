# The `BoostCore` contract lacks the ability to call certain functions of the incentive contracts, such as `clawback()` and `drawRaffle()`

## Summary

The `BoostCore` contract lacks the necessary functions to call the [ERC20Incentive.drawRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet-davies0212/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L137) function.

As a result, triggering the `drawRaffle()` function is impossible, since it can only be called by the owner of the incentive contract, which is the `BoostCore` contract.

The same issue applies to the `clawback()` functions in incentive contracts like [ERC20Incentive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet-davies0212/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L98) and [CGDAIncentive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet-davies0212/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L103).

## Root Cause

As shown in [ERC20Incentive.sol:137](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet-davies0212/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L137), the `drawRaffle()` function can only be called by the owner, which is the `BoostCore` contract. However, there is currently no function within the `BoostCore` contract to invoke this function.

```solidity
137     function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
            if (strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

            LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});

            address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];

            asset.safeTransfer(winnerAddress, reward);
            emit Claimed(winnerAddress, abi.encodePacked(asset, winnerAddress, reward));
        }
```

## Internal pre-conditions

## External pre-conditions

## Attack Path

## Impact

In the raffle strategy, selecting a winner is impossible.

## PoC

## Mitigation

The `BoostCore` contract should provide methods to invoke the `drawRaffle()` function.
