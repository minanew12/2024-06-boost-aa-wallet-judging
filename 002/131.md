# Weak randomness in drawing raffle

### Summary

Weak randomness in drawing raffle

### Root Cause

The RNG process in `drawRaffle` can be manipulated:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L137
```solidity
    /// @notice Draw a winner from the raffle
    /// @dev Only valid when the strategy is set to `Strategy.RAFFLE`
    function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
        if (strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        // easily influenced by miners on Ethereum
        LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});

        address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];

        asset.safeTransfer(winnerAddress, reward);
        emit Claimed(winnerAddress, abi.encodePacked(asset, winnerAddress, reward));
    }
```

Observe that the number output is determined by only two factors, `block.prevrandao` and `block.timestamp`. However, this can be  influenced by block miners on the Ethereum network, by observing the mempool with `drawRaffle` transaction they can determine when to manipulated the blocks to produce the intended result.

### Internal pre-conditions

n/a

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

Block miner needs to observe for `drawRaffle` transaction and then manipulate the blocks.

### Impact

The raffle can be unfairly won.

### PoC

Use Chainlink VRF
