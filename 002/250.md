# Using ``block.prevrandao`` for randomness in raffle might be problematic.

## Summary
The ``ERC20Incentive.sol`` is using block.prevrandao to get randomness in their raffle. This can be problematic since randao can be manipulated to a certain extent combined with the fact that the protocol is intended to be deployed on all possible chains and certain chains such as Arbitrum uses a constant randao value. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In ``ERC20Incentive.sol`` the owner calls ``drawRaffle`` which uses ``block.prevrandao`` for the randomness
```Solidity
   function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
        if (strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});

        address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];

        asset.safeTransfer(winnerAddress, reward);
        emit Claimed(winnerAddress, abi.encodePacked(asset, winnerAddress, reward));
    }
```
But this does not increases randomness due to 2 reasons 
1. ``block.prevrandao`` has a biasability factor to a certain extent : Please refer to [this ](https://soliditydeveloper.com/prevrandao)article
2. Boost protocol will be deployed on all chains and certain chains uses constant value for ``block.prevrandao`` like Arbitrum : [Returns the constant 1.](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/arbitrum-vs-ethereum/solidity-support)

This defeats the whole purpose of raffle if winner is predictable and manipulatable. 

## Impact
Raffle winner can be manipulated/predicted causing unfairness.

## Recommendation
Chainlink VRF's should be used for randomness
