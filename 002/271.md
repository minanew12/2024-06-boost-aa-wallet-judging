# Weak source of randomness in `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle`

### Summary

`block.prevrandao` and `block.timestamp` are not a good source of randomness since they are  manipulatable and predictable values respectively, using values like this to generate randomness can result in results of low integrity since it can be manipulated

### Root Cause

In [`ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L137) we can see that the random number generator depends on `block.prevrandao` which is highly manipulatable and `block.timestamp` which is highly predictable

### Internal pre-conditions

Miners need to manipulate the block.prevrandao 

### External pre-conditions

Owner needs to call `drawRaffle`

### Attack Path

1. Request for randomness
2. Miners manipulate the `prevrandao` value which changes the expected results 

### Impact

using `block.timestamp` offers 0 randomness as is a highly predictable parameter by anyone.
`block.prevrandao` can be manipulated to change results 

### PoC

looking at the code below 

```solidity
    function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
        if (strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        //@audit weak source of randomness
        LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});

        address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];

        asset.safeTransfer(winnerAddress, reward);
        emit Claimed(winnerAddress, abi.encodePacked(asset, winnerAddress, reward));
    }
```

we can see that after the audit tag the "random number generator" depends on two values that is `block.prevrandao` and `block.timestamp`  which offer randomness of low integrity here is why;

`block.prevrandao` - can be manipulated by miners to change the expected outcome(random number) which doesn't make it random again since it can be changed.

`block.timestamp` - offers 0 randomness since it is predictable by anyone


[here is a comment from Patrick Collins explaining the meebits exploit which will help you understand this issue better.](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/understanding-the-meebits-exploit/8281/3)

### Mitigation

Use chainlink VRF in generating random numbers
