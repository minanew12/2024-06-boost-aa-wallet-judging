# Impossible to clawback incentives due to `onlyOwner` modifier

### Summary

Most if not all incentive contracts allow owner to clawback to withdraw distributed assets from the budget contract, however, in reality, it's not possible becasue of the `onlyOwner` modifier. Some other actions, such as `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle` is also not callable due to the same reason.

### Root Cause

Here, we see how incentives are deployed when a new boost is created, in [`_makeIncentives`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L266C1-L291C6), it's clear, that an incentive contract has to be base contract, and it will be initialized by the core contract:
```solidity
    function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
        internal
        returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
    {
        incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
            // Deploy the clone, but don't initialize until it we've preflighted
            _checkTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);

            // Ensure the target is a base implementation (incentive clones are not reusable)
            if (!targets_[i].isBase) {
                revert BoostError.InvalidInstance(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);
            }

            incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], false));

            bytes memory preflight = incentives[i].preflight(targets_[i].parameters);
            if (preflight.length != 0) {
                // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
                assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
            }

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
            incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
        }
    }
```

Let's also randomly pick one incentive contract, and see its initializer function:
```solidity
    function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
        InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));

        if (init_.reward == 0 || init_.limit == 0) revert BoostError.InvalidInitialization();

        // Ensure the maximum reward amount has been allocated
        uint256 maxTotalReward = init_.strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE ? init_.reward * init_.limit : init_.reward;
        uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (available < maxTotalReward) {
            revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, maxTotalReward);
        }

        asset = init_.asset;
        strategy = init_.strategy;
        reward = init_.reward;
        limit = init_.limit;
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    }
```
Which the owner is set to `msg.sender`, the core contract, this makes sense, as all actions are essentially sent by the core function, it would need the owner role to initiate actions. However, for the `clawback` function, we also see `onlyOwner` modifier:

```solidity
function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool)
```

This also means only the core contract is able to call such function, however, in the core contract, there is no entry for calling `clawback` in all incentives, means that if something happens with the incentive contract, making the contract in a broken state, the assets in the contract will be lost forever.



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

`clawback` and `drawRaffle` function can never be called, potentially casuing funds stuck forever.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an option to either transfer ownership, or give authorized users to claw back incentives.
