# clawback() cannot be called, preventing the owner from withdrawing the funds from the contract.

### Summary

**`clawback() `** is designed for the contract owner to withdraw a certain amount of tokens. However, there is an issue: the function is protected by the **`onlyOwner`** modifier, and the owner is set to **`BoostCore.sol`**, which doesn't have any method to trigger the **`clawback()`**. 
Since the intention is for the function to be called by an externally owned account (EOA), not by **`BoostCore.sol`**, this setup prevents the **`clawback()`** from being executed as intended.

### Root Cause

This issue impacts all incentive contracts. For example, let's consider **`CGDAIncentive.sol`**. 

The [clawback()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L103-L112) is implemented as follows:
```Solidity
function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload));
        (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));

        // Transfer the tokens back to the intended recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claim_.target, amount);
        emit Claimed(claim_.target, abi.encodePacked(asset, claim_.target, amount));

        return true;
    }
```
As you can see, the **`clawback()`** has the **`onlyOwner()`** modifier, and the owner is set to **`BoostCore.sol`**. This is evident from the [_maybeClone()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L295), where the ownership is assigned to **`BoostCore.sol`** because is the deployer.

```Solidity
function _maybeClone(BoostLib.Target memory target_, bool shouldInitialize_) internal returns (address instance) {
@>      instance = target_.isBase ? target_.instance.clone() : target_.instance;
        if (target_.isBase && shouldInitialize_) {
            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
            ACloneable(instance).initialize(target_.parameters);
        }
    }
```

This presents a problem because **`BoostCore.sol`** doesn't have any function to trigger the **`clawback()`**, which means the function can never be executed. This setup prevents the intended behavior of allowing the **`clawback()`** to be called.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

**`clawback()`** can't be called, it prevents the owner from withdrawing funds from the contract, which defeats its intended purpose.

### PoC

To reproduce the issue, copy the following POC into **`BoostCore.t.sol`**. For simplicity, we're using **`ERC20Incentive.sol`** in this case, as it's already referenced in the test file.
```Solidity
function testClawbackOnlyCanBeCalledBy_boostCore() public {
        BoostLib.Boost memory boost = boostCore.createBoost(validCreateCalldata);
        assertEq(1, boostCore.getBoostCount());

        bytes memory data = abi.encode(AIncentive.ClawbackPayload({target: address(this), data: abi.encode(uint256(1e18))}));

        //revert not owner
        vm.expectRevert(BoostError.Unauthorized.selector);
        vm.startPrank(address(this));
        boost.incentives[0].clawback(data);

        vm.startPrank(address(boostCore));
        boost.incentives[0].clawback(data); 
    }
```

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, implement a role-based authorization approach that grants specific privileges to both **`BoostCore.sol`** and the EOA administrator for designated functions.
