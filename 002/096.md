# Vulnerable Randomness in drawRaffle() Allows Manipulation of Raffle Results by Malicious Actors

### Summary

The `drawRaffle()` function in `ERC1155Incentive.sol` uses a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) seeded with `block.prevrandao` and `block.timestamp` to select a raffle winner. These values are publicly available and can be manipulated by miners or validators, making the outcome of the raffle predictable or controllable by malicious actors.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L137

This function relies on predictable block properties—block.prevrandao and block.timestamp—to seed the PRNG.

The somme of this two value is passed to `LibPRNG::next` that compute the keccak256 hash of  the data located at the memory address prng, over 32 bytes (0x20). 

* Miners control `block.timestamp` and could adjust it within a small range

* `block.prevrandao` returns the RANDAO value from the previous block, reflecting the randomness of the block immediately before the current block, regardless of when the transaction was initiated.

* Using `entries[_prng.next() % entries.length]` can introduce bias  as the modulo operation may cause some entries to be selected more frequently due to uneven distribution.


### Impact

If the incentives are substantial, a miner or validator could potentially exploit and manipulate the randomness of the draw operation.


### Mitigation

use a verifiable random number generator like Chainlink VRF to ensure fairness and unpredictability.
