# Incentives contracts are initialized by BoostCore, which is missing implementations of certain functions


## Summary

Incentives initialize msg.sender as their owner, calls the owner protected `claim` function in these incentives, but lack other functionalities to access other owner protected functions in the incentives.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user creates a boost, the `_makeIncentives` fucntion is called, and it initializes the incentive.

```solidity
    /// @return incentives The set of initialized incentives {AIncentive[]}
    function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
        internal
        returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
    {
        incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
//...

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
            incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
        }
    }
```

Using ERC1155Incentive.sol as an example, we can see the owner is set as msg.sender, which is BoostCore.sol. 

```solidity
    function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
//...
    }
```

However, there is no implementation for other `onlyOwner` functions like `clawback`, `drawRaffle` will be impossible since they're not implemented in BoostCore.sol. Even ownership transfer will be impossible.

This can be observed in all of the incentive contracts including CGDAIncentive.sol, ERC20Incentive.sol, ERC20VariableIncentive.sol, ERC1155Incentive.sol etc
## Impact

Owner protected functions in the incentives will be inaccessible.
