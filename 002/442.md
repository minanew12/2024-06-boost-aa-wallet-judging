# Predictable Randomness in ERC20Incentive Raffle

## Details

The ERC20Incentive contract employs a raffle system when its strategy is set to Strategy.RAFFLE. This system, intended to fairly distribute rewards, relies on a random number generator (LibPRNG) for selecting a winner. However, the current implementation of this randomness is susceptible to manipulation, making it predictable and potentially unfair.

The drawRaffle function in ERC20Incentive uses block.prevrandao and block.timestamp to seed the LibPRNG library for generating a random winner index.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L140

```solidity
LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});

address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];
```

While this approach might seem sufficiently random, it suffers from a key weakness: both block.prevrandao and block.timestamp are values known or influenceable by miners/validators.

## Impact

The predictability of the random number generation process allows miners/validators, or even participants with advanced knowledge, to potentially manipulate the raffle outcome. This lack of true randomness leads to:

Compromised Fairness: Miners/validators could intentionally include blocks with specific block.prevrandao and block.timestamp values that favor their own or specific addresses, undermining the intended fairness of the raffle.
Reduced User Trust: The possibility of manipulation erodes user trust in the platform's ability to conduct a truly random and fair raffle.

## Scenario

A miner/validator, aware of the raffle mechanism, observes a significant reward pool in an active ERC20Incentive raffle. Intending to win, the miner/validator can manipulate the block.prevrandao and block.timestamp values during block production. By selecting values that, when fed into the LibPRNG, result in their own address winning, they can gain an unfair advantage in the raffle.

## Fix

To address this, a more robust source of randomness should be integrated. One approach is to leverage a decentralized randomness beacon like the Randomness Beacon from Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function).

Example:

Integrate Chainlink VRF into the ERC20Incentive contract to request a random number. This integration involves:

- Chainlink VRF Setup: Register the contract with Chainlink VRF and fund it with LINK tokens to pay for randomness requests.
- Request Randomness: The drawRaffle function, instead of using block.prevrandao and block.timestamp, would initiate a request to Chainlink VRF for a random number.
- Fulfill Randomness: A separate callback function would receive the verifiable random number from Chainlink VRF and use it to select the raffle winner.

This integration significantly enhances the randomness of the raffle as Chainlink VRF provides cryptographically secure random numbers generated off-chain.
