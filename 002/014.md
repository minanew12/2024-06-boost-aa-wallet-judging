# Inability to call `clawback` on incentives prevents boost owners from withdrawing funds.

### Summary

`clawback` functions are implemented in all incentives. Their purpose is to allow the boost owner to withdraw funds in cases there are no claims or funds left in the incentive.

However `clawback` has an `onlyOwner` modifier which authorizes only the `BoostCore` contract to be able to call it. 

`BoostCore` does not have any implementation to call `clawback` - therefore funds that are meant to be pulled via the `clawback` will be stuck and not received by the owner.

### Root Cause

- in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L25 there is no option to call an incentives `clawback`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User creates boost
2. User cannot call `clawback`

### Impact

 Funds that are meant to be pulled via the `clawback` will be stuck and not received by the owner.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a function in the `BoostCore` that can be called by the boost owner to call the incentive's `clawback` function
