# In a raffle, the last claimant can avoid paying the claimFee, gaining an unfair advantage over the others

## Summary
See details.
## Vulnerability Detail
To choose raffle winner, the `drawRaffle()` function is being called, 
```solidity
    function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
        if (strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp}); // block prposer know in the advance

        address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];

        asset.safeTransfer(winnerAddress, reward);
        emit Claimed(winnerAddress, abi.encodePacked(asset, winnerAddress, reward));
    }
```
As can be seen, the `state` parameter is crafted from `block.prevrandao` and `block.timestamp`, which is known to the block proposer in advance. Knowing that will advantage the attacker in possibly two ways; 

Say there are a total of 10 claimants, most of whom have already booked their slots in entries[] via the `claimIncentive()` call, while the last claimant(attacker) has chosen to wait until the owner calls `drawRaffle()`,

where rand = _prng.next() % entries.length; 

### If `rand % 10 == 9`
The entry at the 9th index(or the last claimant) will win the raffle for sure, knowing that, the claimer will proceed to call `claimIncentive()`  before `drawRaffle()` executes, which seems obvious case. 

### If `rand % 10 != 9`
It's clear that he's not the winner, and this is where the unfair advantage comes in for the last claimant. By choosing not to call the `claimIncentive()` function, he avoids paying any fees, while the other users, who trusted the fairness of the protocol, did pay the feeâ€”even though they ended up receiving nothing.


## Impact
The main selling point of the raffle is complete fairness, breaking it would give unfair advantage to attackers.
