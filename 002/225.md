# Weak Randomness Allows Owner to Manipulate Raffle Outcome


## Summary
The `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle` function utilizes weak randomness derived from predictable block values, allowing the contract owner to potentially manipulate the outcome of the raffle and select a preferred winner.

## Vulnerability Detail
The randomness in the `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle` function is based on the sum of `block.prevrandao` and `block.timestamp`, which are both known or predictable by the contract owner. This introduces the risk that the owner could customize or manipulate the randomness to choose a specific raffle winner. As a result, the integrity of the raffle is compromised, leading to unfair outcomes.

## Impact
The raffle's result is vulnerable to manipulation by the contract owner. Instead of relying on truly unpredictable randomness, the owner can potentially predetermine the winner, which undermines trust and fairness in the raffle process. This could lead to loss of trust from participants and potential financial damage if manipulated results benefit specific parties.

## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To improve the randomness and ensure the integrity of the raffle, use a more secure source of randomness such as Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) or another oracle-based solution that guarantees unpredictability and removes the ability for the owner to manipulate the result. This will ensure that the raffle outcome is fair and cannot be influenced by any party.
