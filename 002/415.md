# `BoostCore` will be unable to invoke incentives `clawback` functions

## Summary

In all incentive contracts, only the owner can call the clawback function to retrieve unused funds. However, since `BoostCore` is configured as the owner of all boost incentives and does not include a method to invoke the specific clawback functions for each incentive, any unused funds will be stuck in the incentive contract, and the boost creator will not be able to recover them.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a new boost is created using `BoostCore::createBoost`, all incentives are funded and initialized (by invoking `BoostCore::_makeIncentives`), and the `BoostCore` contract is set as the owner of each incentive.

In all incentive contracts (including CGDAIncentive, ERC1155Incentive, ERC20Incentive, ERC20VariableIncentive), two main functions can be invoked by the contract owner (`BoostCore`): `claim` and `clawback`.

While `BoostCore` allows users to invoke the `claim` method on each incentive using `BoostCore::claimIncentive` and `BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor`, there is no way for the boost creator to invoke the specific `clawback` function on the incentive contracts. This is because `BoostCore`, the owner of all incentives, does not include any method to call the `clawback` functions.

As a result, if any incentive contains remaining or unused funds (ERC20 or ERC1155 tokens), the boost creator will not be able to retrieve those funds through the `clawback` function, leaving the funds stuck in the incentive contract.

## Impact

`BoostCore` is unable to invoke the clawback function on incentive contracts, causing any unused funds to remain stuck in the incentive contract.

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a new method in the `BoostCore` contract that allows the boost creator to invoke the `clawback` function on a given incentive when necessary.
