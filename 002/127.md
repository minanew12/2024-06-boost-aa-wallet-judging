# Missing functionality to draw raffle for ERC20 incentives

### Summary

Missing functionality to draw raffle for ERC20 incentives

### Root Cause

`BoostCore` will always be the owner of all deployed incentives as they are the ones that will always initialize them:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L266-L291
```solidity
    /// @notice Configure a set of incentives for a Boost using the given ABudget
    /// @param targets_ The set of incentives {Target<AIncentive>[]}
    /// @param budget_ The ABudget from which to allocate the incentives
    /// @return incentives The set of initialized incentives {AIncentive[]}
    function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
        internal
        returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
    {
        incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
            // Deploy the clone, but don't initialize until it we've preflighted
            _checkTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);

            // Ensure the target is a base implementation (incentive clones are not reusable)
            if (!targets_[i].isBase) {
                revert BoostError.InvalidInstance(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);
            }

            incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], false));

            bytes memory preflight = incentives[i].preflight(targets_[i].parameters);
            if (preflight.length != 0) {
                // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
                assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
            }

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
            incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
        }
    }
```

But there is no functionality in `BoostCore` to draw the raffle for ERC20 Incentive as it is `onlyOwner` modifier, and only the `BoostCore` contract can be the owner of ERC20 Incentive.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L137-L146
```solidity
    /// @notice Draw a winner from the raffle
    /// @dev Only valid when the strategy is set to `Strategy.RAFFLE`
    function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
        if (strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});

        address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];

        asset.safeTransfer(winnerAddress, reward);
        emit Claimed(winnerAddress, abi.encodePacked(asset, winnerAddress, reward));
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

ERC20 Incentive with raffle strategy

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

n/a

### Impact

The raffle cannot be drawn. All the tokens in ERC20Incentive will be stuck forever.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
