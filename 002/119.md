# Incorrect access control breaks clawback and raffle for all boost incentives

## Summary
The `clawback` functions of every boost incentive and the `raffle` functionality of `ERC20Incentive` are broken due to incorrect access control. This breaks a core contract functionality as well as loss of funds across boosts.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a boost is created, the `_makeIncentives` function is called to set the `incentives` field:


```solidity
    function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
...
        InitPayload memory payload_ = abi.decode(data_.cdDecompress(), (InitPayload));
...
        boost.incentives = _makeIncentives(payload_.incentives, payload_.budget);
```

This function clones the incentive contracts of the boost (which must not be reused between boosts) and initializes it:

```solidity
    function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
        internal
        returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
    {
        incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
            // Deploy the clone, but don't initialize until it we've preflighted
            _checkTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);


            // Ensure the target is a base implementation (incentive clones are not reusable)
            if (!targets_[i].isBase) {
                revert BoostError.InvalidInstance(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);
            }


            incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], false));


            bytes memory preflight = incentives[i].preflight(targets_[i].parameters);
            if (preflight.length != 0) {
                // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
                assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
            }


            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
            incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
        }
    }
```

Inside of each `incentive` contract, the owner is set upon the call to `initialize`, to be the `msg.sender`. As a result, `BoostCore` will be the owner of each incentive contract. Various functionality of the incentive contracts are permissioned behind this owner status, such as `claim` and `clawback`, as well as `drawRaffle` of `ERC20Incentive`. 

`BoostCore` includes logic to allow for claiming of incentives by using its permissioned status as the owner to call the `claim` function. However, no such logic exists to call `clawback` of any of the incentiev contracts or `drawRaffle` of `ERC20Incentive`. Further, there is no logic to transfer ownership of the incentive contract to the boost owner or allow him to forward arbitrary calls. As a result these functions will be totally inaccessible, breaking their functionality across all boosts.

## Impact
All boosts are impacted by potential loss of funds and broken contract functionality. The `clawback` function ordinarily allows for boost creators to terminate their incentive program before all the rewards have been distributed, such as when a deadline is reached or engagement with the boost has plateaued. Given that this is a core, stated functionality of boosts/incentive programs, creators stand to lose significant funds as a result. Additionally, unbeknownst to the boost creator any funds allocated to a misconfigured boost will be totally irretrievable, further compounding the error.

The `drawRaffle` function of `ERC20Incentive` is also broken, so not only can the boost creator not get funds back but this type of boost will also be incapable of distributing any rewards, resulting in total loss of funds allocated to the boost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using `OwnableRoles` and give the boost creator permissioned access to these described functions.

Alternatively consider allowing the boost owner to make arbitrary calls that are forwarded to the `BoostCore` contract.
