# Weak Randomness in drawRaffle() Function Allows Manipulation by Block Proposers

## Summary
A weak randomness vulnerability exists in the `ERC20Incentive.sol` contract, specifically in the `drawRaffle()` function, which calculates random numbers using `LibPRNG::next()` with `block.prevrandao` and `block.timestamp`. Since `block.prevrandao` is deprecated on many chains and returns a constant value (like 0), the random number becomes predictable and vulnerable to manipulation by the block proposer.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ERC20Incentive.sol` contract features two reward distribution methods, one of which is a raffle-based system. In the raffle system, the `drawRaffle()` function picks a single winner by generating a random number using the `LibPRNG::next()` function. This random number generator relies on two inputs: `block.prevrandao` and `block.timestamp`.

However, there are two major issues with this approach:

1. Predictable Randomness: The `block.prevrandao` input, which is deprecated in many modern blockchain environments (such as Arbitrum [Arbitrum Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/arbitrum-vs-ethereum/solidity-support)), returns a constant 0 in certain contexts. This results in a predictable value being passed to LibPRNG, reducing the randomness to a function of just `block.timestamp`.

2. Manipulable by Block Proposers: Since the block timestamp is set by the block proposer (miner or validator), they can manipulate it to favor certain outcomes. By adjusting the block timestamp, the block proposer can ensure that a specific address wins the raffle, leading to unfair rewards distribution.

This is especially concerning on chains where `block.prevrandao` is deprecated or ineffective, leaving only the timestamp as the primary source of randomness, which is easily influenced.

## Impact
1. Loss of Fairness
2. Protocol Manipulation
3. Attacker can get whole reward from the raffle.
