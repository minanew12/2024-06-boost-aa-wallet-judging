# Raffle winner unable to claim prize in `RAFFLE` incentive strategy

### Summary

When the incentive strategy is set to `RAFFLE`, the random raffle winner who completes the boost action is unable to claim their prize. This issue arises because the `BoostCore` contract never calls the `drawRaffle` function, which is responsible for selecting a random raffle winner and distributing the prize.


### Root Cause

Boost participants attempt to claim their prize by calling `BoostCore::claim`, which interacts with the incentive contract to finalize the claim
```solidity
function claimIncentiveFor( uint256 boostId_, uint256 incentiveId_, address referrer_, bytes calldata data_, address claimant ) public payable nonReentrant {
    // --SNIP
>>>    if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```
The incentive contract offers two strategies, `POOL` and `RAFFLE`. In the case of `RAFFLE`, the `claim` function registers participants but does not select a winner:
```solidity
// ERC20Incentive

function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();

    if (strategy == Strategy.POOL) {//...} 
    else {
        claims++;
        claimed[claimTarget] = true;
>>>        entries.push(claimTarget);

        emit Entry(claimTarget);
        return true;
    }
}
```
As seen above, the winner is not determined yet but the claimant is pushed to the `entries` array in which [a random winner will be selected](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L137-L146) later via `drawRaffle`. The actual raffle draw happens in `drawRaffle`, **which can only be called by the `BoostCore` contract**
```solidity
function drawRaffle() external override 
>>>    onlyOwner 
{
    if (strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

    LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});

    address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];

>>>    asset.safeTransfer(winnerAddress, reward);
    emit Claimed(winnerAddress, abi.encodePacked(asset, winnerAddress, reward));
}
```

Since BoostCore never calls `drawRaffle`, the raffle winner is never selected, and no prize is distributed.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The incentive strategy configured for a boost is `RAFFLE`.


### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- A boost is created with an incentive strategy set to `RAFFLE`
- Boost participants call `BoostCore::claim` to be registered as raffle participants after completing their actions.
- The `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle` function, which selects the winner and distributes the prize, is never called by `BoostCore`.
- As a result, no raffle winner is selected, and no prize is awarded.

### Impact

For boosts using the `RAFFLE` incentive strategy, no raffle winner will ever be selected, preventing prize distribution and defeating the purpose of the boost incentive.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider modifying the `ERC20Incentive::claim` function to automatically call `drawRaffle` when the maximum number of claims is reached. Additionally, adjust the visibility of `drawRaffle` to make it an internal function:
```diff
// ERC20Incentive

function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();

    if (strategy == Strategy.POOL) {//...} 
    else {
        claims++;
        claimed[claimTarget] = true;
        entries.push(claimTarget);

+       if (claims == limit) drawRaffle();

        emit Entry(claimTarget);
        return true;
    }
}

function drawRaffle()  override 
-    external onlyOwner 
+   internal
{
    // --SNIP
}
```
