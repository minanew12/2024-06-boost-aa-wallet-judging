# Inability to Reclaim Assets and Draw Raffle Winner due to BoostCore Ownership

## Summary
Users cannot reclaim assets from the `Incentive` contract family or determine the winner for the raffle in the `ERC20Incentive` contract because the `BoostCore` contract is the owner of the `Incentive` contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `initialize` function of the `Incentive` contract family, the contract's owner is set to the `msg.sender`:

```Solidity
function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
    ...
=>  _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    ...
}
```
In the `BoostCore::createBoost` function, the list of incentives for the new `Boost` is initialized by the `BoostCore` contract, making it the owner of the Incentive contracts.

[BoostCore::_makeIncentives](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L266-L291) function:
```Solidity
function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_) internal returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
{
    incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
        ...
        // This contract will be the owner of the Incentive contract
=>      incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
    }
}
```

However, the `BoostCore` contract lacks any functions to call the `AIncentive::clawback` function, which requires the owner role to reclaim assets from the Incentive contracts. Additionally, in the `ERC20Incentive` contract, there is a `drawRaffle` function that also requires the owner role. Since the `BoostCore` contract does not define any methods to call this function, the `ERC20Incentive` contract cannot determine the winner of the raffle.

`AIncentive::clawback` function:
```Solidity
function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    ...
}
```

`ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle` function:
```Solidity
function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
    ...
}
```

## Impact
- Assets cannot be reclaimed from the Incentive contracts
- The `ERC20Incentive` contract cannot determine the winner for the raffle

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement functions in the `BoostCore` contract that allow users to reclaim assets from the Incentive contracts and find the winner for the raffle in the `ERC20Incentive` contract.
