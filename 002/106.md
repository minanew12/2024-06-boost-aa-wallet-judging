# Both block.prevrandao and block.timestamp are not reliably source of randonness

## Summary

Both block.prevrandao and block.timestamp are not reliably source of randonness

## Vulnerability Detail

In the ERC20Incentive.sol, 

```solidity
    function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
        if (strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});

        address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];

        asset.safeTransfer(winnerAddress, reward);
        emit Claimed(winnerAddress, abi.encodePacked(asset, winnerAddress, reward));
    }
```

the code use block.prevrandao and block.timestamp as source of randoness to determine who is lucky to win the raffle.

However, both op code are not good source of randonness.

>  Security Considerations
> The PREVRANDAO (0x44) opcode in PoS Ethereum (based on the beacon chain RANDAO implementation) is a source of randomness with different properties to the randomness supplied by BLOCKHASH (0x40) or DIFFICULTY (0x44) opcodes in the PoW network.

 > Biasability
> The beacon chain RANDAO implementation gives every block proposer 1 bit of influence power per slot. Proposer may deliberately refuse to propose a block on the opportunity cost of proposer and transaction fees to prevent beacon chain randomness (a RANDAO mix) from being updated in a particular slot.

## Impact

Miner can manipulate the block.prevrandao and block.timestamp to let specific address win the raffle

## Recommendation

change randon generate method (can use chainlink VRF, etc...)
