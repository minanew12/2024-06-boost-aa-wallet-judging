# Insecure randomness leads to manipulation of the raffle winner in ERC20Incentive

## Summary
Winner in `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle()` can be manipulated by miner because it relies on `block.timestamp` as source of randomness.

## PoC
1. Assuming that the Strategy is set to RAFFLE in the ERC20Incentive contract initialization. 
2. Owner claims multiple claim targets using `claim` function. Thus adding the targets to the `entries` array.
3. Owner calls `drawRaffle()` expecting a random address from the `entries` to win.
4. Malicious miner holds the tx until gets a favorable `block.timestamp` of which the `winnerAddress` is in his favor.
Other `claimTarget`s did not get fair chance

## Impact
Unfair reward distribution.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a more robust source of randomness, such as Chainlink VRF.
