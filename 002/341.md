# Lack of external function in the `BoostCore` contract to call the `clawback()` function on all types of incentives causes the `clawback()` function to not work at all

### Summary

All `clawback()` functions on all incentive types (`AllowListIncentive`, `CGDAIncentive`, `ERC1155Incentive`, `ERC20Incentive`, `ERC20VariableIncentive` and `PointsIncentive`) have the `onlyOwner` modifier which means only the owner of the contract can call the function. The main problem is that the owner of the contract is `BoostCore` and in the `BoostCore` contract there is no external function to call the `clawback()` function, this causes all `clawback()` functions for all incentive types to be completely unusable.

### Root Cause

*In [BoostCore.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L25) there is no function to call `clawback()` on all all types of incentives*

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

`clawback()` function on all type of incentives are completely unusable

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider add external function to call `clawback()` on `BoostCore` with modifier (for boost owner or admin roles)
