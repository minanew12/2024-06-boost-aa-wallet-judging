# Boost creator could not withdraw tokens from incentive

### Summary

If boost creator decide take his tokens back from incentive (for example, his boost is not popular), he could not do it, because function clawback() has wrong access control. His tokens will be locked in the incentive contract forever. 

### Root Cause

In `CGDAIncentive.sol`, `ERC20Incentive.sol`, `ERC1155Incentive.sol` and in `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol` function `clawback()` has modifier onlyOwner, but boost creator could not call it, because owner of incentive contracts is BoostCore contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

Boost with one(or some) of these incentive (CGDAIncentive, ERC20Incentive, ERC1155Incentive, ERC20VariableIncentive)

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Boost creator create boost with one(or some) of these incentive (CGDAIncentive, ERC20Incentive, ERC1155Incentive, ERC20VariableIncentive)
2. Creator decide take back tokens (all or remaining part) from incentive contract.
3. Tx revert, because creator is not owner of incentive contract. Owner is BoostCore contract.

### Impact

Creator tokens will be locked in the incentive contract forever

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add new modfier to function clawback(), which will check that msg.sender is boost creator.
