# Using weak source of randomness via block.prevrandao + block.timestamp for generating winner from the raffle

## Summary
The  `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle` function is vulnerable due to its use of insecure randomness. The function relies on `block.prevrandao + block.timestamp` as the source of randomness to enhance the security and fairness of random number which is predictable and can be manipulated by miners. **This method is vulnerable to front-running attacks and predictable sequences.** This can lead to the raffle being unfairly influenced, compromising the integrity of the raffle process.
## Vulnerability Detail
While not immediately predictable, patterns may emerge after many draws. **The `ERC20Incentive:drawRaffle` function uses `block.prevrandao + block.timestamp` as the source of randomness. This approach is insecure because both `block.prevrandao` and` block.timestamp` are predictable and can be manipulated by miners. This predictability allows malicious actors to influence the outcome of the winner of the raffle, compromising its fairness.**
## Impact
The use of `block.prevrandao + block.timestamp` is not a secure source of randomness. Miners can influence `block.timestamp` and potentially `block.prevrandao`, making the outcome predictable. 
After a few draws, the pattern becomes clear, allowing attackers to predict future winners. Integrity and fairness of the raffle are compromised, leading to potential loss of trust among participants.

## Proof of Concept
```javascript
function testPredictableRandomness() public {
    // Initialize the ERC20Incentive raffling 100 eth to 5 entrants
    _initialize(address(mockAsset), AERC20Incentive.Strategy.RAFFLE, 100 ether, 5);

    // Claim the incentive for 5 different addresses
    address[] memory recipients = _randomAccounts(5);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        incentive.claim(recipients[i], hex"");
    }

    // Perform multiple draws to demonstrate predictable randomness
    uint256 numDraws = 10;
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < numDraws; i++) {
        // Mock the environment so our PRNG is seeded with a known value
        vm.prevrandao(bytes32(uint256(i)));
        
        // Warp the block timestamp to a consistent value
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + i * 3600); // Warp every hour
        
        // Draw the raffle
        incentive.drawRaffle();
        
        // Check if the winner is consistent across draws
        assertEq(entries[incentive.getWinnerIndex()], recipients[0]);
        
        // Print the seed for debugging
        console.log("Seed:", bytes32(uint256(i)));
    }

    // Assert that the winners are consistent across all draws
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < numDraws; i++) {
        assertEq(entries[incentive.getWinnerIndex()], recipients[0]);
    }
}
```

## Recommendation
Replace the current randomness source with a more secure one, such as Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function), to ensure the integrity and fairness of the raffle.
Also consider the use of a Commit-Reveal Scheme to enhance the security and fairness of random number.
