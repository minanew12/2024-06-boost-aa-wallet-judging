# ERC20Incentive.sol: drawRaffle randomness source is not random

### Summary

The contract uses a pseudo random number generator to draw a winner based on the current prevrandao and the block timestamp [see](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L140).
