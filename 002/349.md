# Predictable randomness vulnerability in Boost's raffle draw function

## Summary

A vulnerability exists in the Boost project's `drawRaffle` function, which uses an insecure pseudorandom number generator from block data (`block.prevrandao` and `block.timestamp`). This approach makes the randomness predictable, allowing an attacker to potentially manipulate the raffle result.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `drawRaffle` function relies on the following code:

```solidity
LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});
address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];
```

This implementation leverages `block.prevrandao` and `block.timestamp` to determine the raffle winner. Both these values are publicly accessible and, more importantly, can be influenced by miners within certain limits. By manipulating `block.timestamp` slightly, a malicious miner could exploit this predictability to influence the raffle's outcome and select a desired winner, undermining the fairness of the process.

## Impact

An attacker can manipulate or predict the winner of a raffle, undermining the fairness of the incentive mechanism.

## Tool Used
VSCode

## Recommendation

Replace the PRNG mechanism with a verifiable randomness solution such as Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to ensure secure and unbiased randomness in the raffle draw process.

```solidity
// Example of integrating Chainlink VRF for secure randomness
bytes32 requestId = requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);

// Chainlink VRF callback function
function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override {
    uint256 winnerIndex = randomness % entries.length;
    address winner = entries[winnerIndex];
    // Award prize to the winner
}
```
