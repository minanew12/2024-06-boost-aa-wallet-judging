# BoostedCore lack functions to invoke incentive#clawback and incentive#drawRaffle function

## Summary

BoostedCore lack functions to invoke incentive#clawback and incentive#drawRaffle function 

```solidity
    function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload));
        (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));

        if (strategy == Strategy.RAFFLE) {
            // Ensure the amount is the full reward and there are no raffle entries, then reset the limit
            if (amount != reward || claims > 0) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));
            limit = 0;
        } else {
            // Ensure the amount is a multiple of the reward and reduce the max claims accordingly
            if (amount % reward != 0) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));
            limit -= amount / reward;
        }

        // Transfer the tokens back to the intended recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claim_.target, amount);
        emit Claimed(claim_.target, abi.encodePacked(asset, claim_.target, amount));

        return true;
    }
```

and

```solidity
 function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
        if (strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});

        address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];

        asset.safeTransfer(winnerAddress, reward);
        emit Claimed(winnerAddress, abi.encodePacked(asset, winnerAddress, reward));
    }
```

these two function in incentive contract has the onlyOwner modifier, yet the owner is the boostedCore, but because the boostedCore only has the code to [call claim function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L177),

but not the function incentive#drawRaffle and incentive#clawback,

then even the owner deploy a incentive contract with raffle strategy, the function cannot be called and no one cam Reclaim assets from the incentive via clawback function

## Vulnerability Detail

In Boosted Core, add function to trigger clawback and drawRaffle because the boostedCore contract [hold the ownership](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L128) of the incentive contract.

## Impact

partial lock of fund because the function clawback and draw raffle is designed to move fund out.
