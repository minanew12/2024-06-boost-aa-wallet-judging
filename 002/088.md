# MEDIUM-02 - Some Incentives methods with onlyOwner access are not callable.

### Summary

The following methods in `contracts/incentives/` are not callable as they are only callable by `onlyOwner`which is `BoostCore.sol`, but `BoostCore.sol` doesn't implement any logic to call this methods. Specifically: `drawRaffle()` and `clawback()`.

Instances: 
[ERC1155Incentives::clawback()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC1155Incentive.sol#L104),
[CGDAIncentive::clawback()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L103),
[ERC20Incentive::clawback()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L98), 
[ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L137),
[ERC20VariableIncentive::clawback()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20VariableIncentive.sol#L98)


### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will prevent any incentive to reclaim their funds through `clawback()` and the ability to call `drawRaffle()`. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding different access controls as those methods being able to be called from `BoostCore.sol` might cause some problems as stated in issue #2. For example, implementing a manager role that is able to call those functions.
