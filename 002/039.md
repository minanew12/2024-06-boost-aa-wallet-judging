# BoostCore has missing functionality to `clawback()` unused funds from the Incentive contract

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
There is `clawback()` functionality to withdraw unused funds from the incentives contract. This function is restricted to the owner only (i.e., the Boostcore contract). The issue is that the core contract doesnâ€™t have the functionality to call the `clawback()` function, which leaves unused or excess funds being stuck in the Incentive contract. 

## Impact
Unused funds are temporarily stuck

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a permissioned function to BoostCore that calls `clawback()` on the incentive contract.
