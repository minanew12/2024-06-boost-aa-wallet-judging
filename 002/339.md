# There is no logic to call clawBack() in few base incentive contracts

## Summary
`clawBack()` in few base incentive contracts are supposed to be called by BoostCore contract, because the initialzie() of those incentive contracts are called from BoostCore contract i.e this contract is owner, but the BoostCore contract does not have any logic to call clawBack(). as result that function cannot be called.
## Vulnerability Detail
In ERC1155Incentive, CGDAIncentive,  ERC20Incentive & ERC20VariableIncentive contract the owner is set in initialize(), the caller of the initialize() is set as owner. As the in-built Incentive base contracts are initialized from BoostCore contract the BoostCore contract calls the initialize() of those incentive contracts, as a result that contract is set as owner for those incentives. The clawBack() is supposed to be called by owner, it is called to reclaim assets from incentive. But the problem is there is no logic in BoostCore contract to call clawBack() on incentives, as the no one except BoostCore contract can call this function the fund can not be reclaimed.
## Impact
Asset can not be reclaimed from those incentive contracts

## Recommendation
Implement logic in BoostCore contract to call the clawBack().
