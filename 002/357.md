# Boost Creator Loses Access to Reclaim Funds Due to Owner Assignment in Deployed Incentive Contracts

## Summary
`BoostCore.sol` allows the creation of multiple incentive contracts like `CGDAIncentive.sol`, `ERC20Incentive.sol`, `ERC1155Incentive.sol`, and `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol`. These contracts are deployed with the owner set as `BoostCore` due to `_initializeOwner(msg.sender)` This design flaw restricts the Boost creator from reclaiming funds using the clawback function, as `BoostCore` cannot call it, resulting in potential permanent loss of funds if no users participate in the boost.

## Vulnerability Detail

`BoostCore.sol::createBoost()` function is responsible for deploying incentive contracts, which include contracts like `CGDAIncentive.sol`, `ERC20Incentive.sol`, `ERC1155Incentive.sol`, and `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol`. Each of these contracts contains an initialization function `_initializeOwner(msg.sender)` that sets the owner of the contract.

Since these contracts are deployed by BoostCore, the owner is automatically set to the BoostCore contract. The deployed contracts include two important functions `claim` and `clawback` that can only be called by the owner of the contract (which is BoostCore).

While the claim function can be triggered by `BoostCore`, there is no functionality within BoostCore to call `clawback()`. This limitation is critical because it prevents the Boost creator from reclaiming funds in the event no participants claim the boost. Essentially, without access to the clawback function, the funds are locked permanently, leading to potential loss for the Boost creator.

## Impact
Funds allocated to a boost may be permanently locked if no one participated in the boost and the clawback function cannot be executed, as BoostCore cannot call it and the Boost creator lacks direct control.

## Recommendation

Add one more role as an admin and give access to the Boost Creator for direct access of clawback or any other main functionality.
