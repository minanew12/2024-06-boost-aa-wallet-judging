# Ownership flaw in `ERC20Incentive` contract prevents raffle draw and locks funds

## Summary

A vulnerability exists in the Boost projectâ€™s `ERC20Incentive` contract due to the `drawRaffle` function being restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier. Since `BoostCore` becomes the owner of the contract upon initialization, the actual Boost deployer (the person creating the Boost) cannot invoke this function, preventing them from drawing a raffle and selecting a winner. Additionally, the `clawback` function is also inaccessible, leading to the permanent locking of funds in the contract. This causes financial loss for both the Boost owner and participating users who are unable to claim their rewards. Such a scenario damages the integrity of both the Boost protocol and the project the Boost is promoting.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises from how the `ERC20Incentive` contracts are initialized. During the creation of a Boost, the `BoostCore::createBoost` function initializes these contracts, making `BoostCore` the owner. The following code demonstrates this:

[BoostCore#L125-L128](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L125-L128)
```solidity
function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
        external
        canCreateBoost(msg.sender)
        nonReentrant
        returns (BoostLib.Boost memory)
    {
        InitPayload memory payload_ = abi.decode(data_.cdDecompress(), (InitPayload));

        ...
        // Setup the Boost components
        boost.action = AAction(_makeTarget(type(AAction).interfaceId, payload_.action, true));
        boost.allowList = AAllowList(_makeTarget(type(AAllowList).interfaceId, payload_.allowList, true));
@>      boost.incentives = _makeIncentives(payload_.incentives, payload_.budget);
        ...
    }
```

The `_makeIncentives` function initializes the incentive contracts:

[BoostCore#L289](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L289)
```solidity
function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
    internal
    returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
{
    incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
        ...
@>       incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
    }
}
```

The `ERC20Incentive` contract sets `BoostCore` as the owner through its `initialize` function:

[ERC20Incentive#L52](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L52)
```solidity
function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
    ...
    _initializeOwner(msg.sender);  // msg.sender is BoostCore
}
```

Because of this, the Boost deployer does not have ownership of the contract and cannot invoke functions like `drawRaffle`, which are gated by the `onlyOwner` modifier:

[ERC20Incentive#L137](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L137)
```solidity
function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner { ... }
```

Since the Boost deployer is not the owner, they are unable to draw a raffle winner, leading to unfulfilled promises to participating users.

## Impact

This issue prevents the Boost deployer from selecting a raffle winner. Moreover, since `BoostCore` is the owner, the `clawback` function is also unusable, preventing the reclaiming of funds and effectively locking assets within the `ERC20Incentive` contract permanently.

The severity of this issue is high, as it leads to financial losses for both the Boost deployer and users, while also compromising the integrity of the Boost protocol and the project the Boost is promoting, as users cannot receive their rewards.

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, consider the following solution:

 **Delegate raffle drawing functionality to BoostCore**:  
   Implement a new function within `BoostCore` that allows the Boost deployer to invoke `drawRaffle` on the `ERC20Incentive` contract, ensuring that only the Boost deployer has access to this function.

```solidity
   function drawRaffleIncentive(uint256 incentiveId) external onlyOwner {
       incentives[incentiveId].drawRaffle();
   }
```
