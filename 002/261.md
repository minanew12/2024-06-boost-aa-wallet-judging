# ERC20Incentive.drawRaffle() uses a weak RNG mechanism

## Summary
ERC20Incentive.drawRaffle() uses a weak RNG mechanism

## Vulnerability Detail
ERC20Incentive.drawRaffle() uses a library that generates RNG to determine the raffle winner. However, this library is not 100% random, as it works with predictable variables and functions (block.prevrandao, block.timestamp, keccak256) in a deterministic way, which means that anybody who knows this variables can predict the winner slot; some users can also make an influence in variables' values.

## Impact
The method used to determine the winner of the raffle is not 100% random and could even be manipulated, leading to an unfair way of choosing the winner.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Best suggestion for this issue is to make use of a service that can provide 100% random values, free of external manipulation. Chainlink is capable of fulfilling this requirement, for example.
