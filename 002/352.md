# clawback() can't be executed because the owner is always BoostCore

## Summary

The incentive contracts that store tokens have a clawback function, which allows the owner to withdraw the funds at will. This is a form of protective mechanism in case of a problem. This function has the onlyOwner modifier. In the case of the incentive contracts defined in the protocol, the only way for them to be added to a boost is by being cloned from a base contract during the creation of the boost. It is not possible to submit an already initialized and ready-to-use contract. This means that the owner of these contracts becomes the msg.sender of the initialize function, which is BoostCore.

The problem is that BoostCore has no mechanism for calling the clawback, so this function cannot be called for any of these contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

An example of this issue is the clawback function in the ERC20Incentive contract.

```solidity
function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload));
    (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));


    if (strategy == Strategy.RAFFLE) {
        // Ensure the amount is the full reward and there are no raffle entries, then reset the limit
        if (amount != reward || claims > 0) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));
        limit = 0;
    } else {
        // Ensure the amount is a multiple of the reward and reduce the max claims accordingly
        if (amount % reward != 0) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));
        limit -= amount / reward;
    }


    // Transfer the tokens back to the intended recipient
    asset.safeTransfer(claim_.target, amount);
    emit Claimed(claim_.target, abi.encodePacked(asset, claim_.target, amount));


    return true;
}
```

## Impact

In case of emergency the assets can't be withdrawn from the contracts. Broken core functionality.

## Recommendation

Add an ability to BoostCore to execute clawback() function.
