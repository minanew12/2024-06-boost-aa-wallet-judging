# `clawback()` function can't be called by the owner of the boost due to wrong owner checking

### Summary

`clawback()` function can't be called by the boost owner because of wrong modifier

### Root Cause

Based on the README:

> Assuming an ERC20Incentive and SignerValidator regardless of future modules or integrations given these two modules for a boost the only path to disburse funds should be through boostCore:claimIncentive or directly through clawback.

In the current implementation `clawback()` functions is impossible to call in all the incentive modules due to wrong modifier. The owner of the incentives is BoostCore contract. 

[Example incentive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L98) ( But also all the other incentives have this problem )

```solidity
    function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
        InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));

        if (init_.reward == 0 || init_.limit == 0) revert BoostError.InvalidInitialization();

        // Ensure the maximum reward amount has been allocated
        uint256 maxTotalReward = init_.strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE ? init_.reward * init_.limit : init_.reward;
        uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (available < maxTotalReward) {
            revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, maxTotalReward);
        }

        asset = init_.asset;
        strategy = init_.strategy;
        reward = init_.reward;
        limit = init_.limit;
&>      _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    }
```

```solidity
    function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
        internal
        returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
    {
        incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
            // Deploy the clone, but don't initialize until it we've preflighted
            _checkTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);

            // Ensure the target is a base implementation (incentive clones are not reusable)
            if (!targets_[i].isBase) {
                revert BoostError.InvalidInstance(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);
            }

            incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], false));

            bytes memory preflight = incentives[i].preflight(targets_[i].parameters);
            if (preflight.length != 0) {
                // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
                assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
            }

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
&>          incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
        }
    }
```

### Impact

Medium - Because `clawback()` function can't be called by the boost owner which is main invariant based on the README. It's also impossible to clawback from Boost Core contract because it's not implemented

### Mitigation

`onlyOwner` modifier for `clawback()` function should be changed to `onlyBoostOwner()` ( it should be implemented )
