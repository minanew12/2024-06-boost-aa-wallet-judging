# The clawback function in the incentives contracts cant be called

### Summary

This issue affects the following contracts and functions:
- [ERC20Incentive.sol::clawback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L98-L117)
- [ERC20VariableIncentive.sol::clawback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20VariableIncentive.sol#L98-L109)
- [ERC1155Incentive.sol::clawback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC1155Incentive.sol#L85-L101)
- [CGDAIncentive.sol::clawback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L103-L112)
- [PointsIncentive.sol::clawback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/PointsIncentive.sol#L69-L71) (`NotImplemented` for now)
- [AllowListIncentive.sol::clawback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/AllowListIncentive.sol#L56-L58) (`NotImplemented` for now)

The issue in those contracts all share the same root cause. The contracts are deployed as proxies by the `BoostCore.sol`. Therefor the msg.sender in the  `initialize` function is that core contract. This contract does not have any function to forward those `clawback` calls. As those functions are owner only functions, the boost creator can not call them directly.


### Root Cause

The following root cause is for the `ERC20Incentive.sol` contract, but is applicable for all other affected contracts, as they share a common root cause:

The Boost protocol uses a registry to register `base` contracts as the implementation of the different contracts used. A user can create a boost by calling [BoostCore.sol::createBoost](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L106-L144). This deploys proxies based on the chooses base contracts (implementations) and also calls the proxies initialize functions. Thus the msg.sender in the [ERC20Incentive.sol::initialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L36-L53) function is the core contact. This sets the core contract as the owner of the proxy. This is needed to allow the core to call the [ERC20Incentive.sol::claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L76-L95) function.

But the core protocol lacks a function to allow the Boost creator to forward calls to the [ERC20Incentive.sol::clawback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L98-L117) function. Therefor the creator can not clawback outstanding rewards and his money is stuck.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Creators assets can not be clawbacked from the incentive contract

### PoC

N/A missing function

### Mitigation

Add a function in the core contract to allow the creator to forward calls to clawback. Could look like this:

```solidity
function clawback(uint256 boostId_, uint256 incentiveId_, bytes calldata data_) external nonReentrant {
    BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
    if (!boost.owner == msg.sender) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
    if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].clawback(data_)) {
        revert BoostError.ClawbackFailed(msg.sender, data_);
    }
}
```
