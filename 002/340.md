# Lack of logic in BoostCore contract ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle() cannot be called

## Summary
It is not possible to call drawRaffle() ever.
## Vulnerability Detail
The ERC20Incentive contract can be initialized with 2 strategy - 1. POOL & 2. RAFFLE. If the incentive initialized with RAFFLE strategy then owner is responsible to call the drawRaffle() to decide the winner of the raffle. The owner is set in initialize(), the caller of the initialize() is set as owner. As the initialize() is called from BoostCore contract the BoostCore is set as owner. So it is obvious that the drawRaffle() is supposed to get called from BoostCore contract, but the problem is that the contract does not have any logic to call the drawRaffle(). As a result this function can not be called.
## Impact
Calling ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle() from BoostCore contract is not possible so winner will never be decided.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a logic to call drawRaffle() inside BoostCore contract.
