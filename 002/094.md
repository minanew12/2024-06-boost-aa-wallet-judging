# `AIncentive::clawback` function is inaccessible and cannot be called

### Summary

While all incentive contracts implement a `clawback` function, which is controlled by the owner (`BoostCore`) to reclaim assets from incentives, there is currently no functionality in `BoostCore` to call `clawback`, rendering it unusable and unreachable.


### Root Cause

The `clawback` function, designed to allow `BoostCore` to reclaim assets from incentive contracts, is implemented across all incentive contracts. However, [BoostCore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L25) lacks an implementation that calls the `clawback` function, making the reclaim feature ineffective and inaccessible.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.


### External pre-conditions

None.


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `clawback` function in all incentive contracts is effectively unusable, as it cannot be called due to the lack of integration with `BoostCore`. This could result in an inability to reclaim assets from incentives, leading to operational inefficiencies or asset recovery issues.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding the necessary functionality in `BoostCore` to trigger the `AIncentive::clawback` function
