# Authorization Issues With The Budget Owner

## Summary

The incentive can be deployed via the Boost Registry or via Cloning in the Boost Core contract , this means the owner of the incentive would either be the Core contract or the other , Incentive contracts have the functionality of clawBack (assume there are no participants and the owner of the boost want to take back his assets from the incentive ) but this functionality is neither in the Boost Core nor in the Registry (and clawback is restricted to onlyOwner) therefore funds will be stuck in the incentive.

The impact is not limited to just clawbacks , functions such as `drawRaffle()` are also onlyOwner and would be un-callable (hence the raffle would never get executed in this case)

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) A boost is created and an incentive is provided , assume this is the ERC20Incentive ->

The assets would be disbursed to the incentive here 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L285

When the incentive is initialized in the core ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L289

and the owner is assigned as the msg.sender in the incentive (which would be BoostCore) ->

2.) Now the creator wants to clawback his funds because there is no participation and he wants his assets back , since the owner of the incentive is the BoostCore contract and the BoostCore contract has no functionality implemented for clawback the funds would be stuck in the incentive contract forever.

The same can be argued for `drawRaffle()` function in the ERC20Incentive.sol and more such function where owner is the Boost core but no way to call those functions form the core contract.

## Impact

Inability to call clawback leads to inactive funds getting stuck in the incentive contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The clawback should be implemented in the core contract.
