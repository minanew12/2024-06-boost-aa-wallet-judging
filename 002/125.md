# Boost Creators Unable to Retrieve Funds or Draw Raffle Winners Due to Missing Entry Points

### Summary

When a user wants to create a new boost, `BoostCore`  clone the incentives contract from a base contract. The cloned incentive contract has no owner until `BoostCore` calls the `initialize` function to assume ownership. This creates a situation where funds are tied up in incentive contracts.

### Root Cause

In the incentives contract, functions like `clawback` and `drawRaffle` are restricted to be called only by the owner:

```solidity
function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner

function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner
```

However, in the `BoostCore` contract, there is no designated entry point to call these functions, meaning the core contract does not provide a direct way for the boost owner to execute these restricted functions within the cloned incentive contracts.

### Impact

Boost creators won't be able to draw a winner for a raffle, causing the funds to be stuck if they attempt to create a raffle. Additionally, Boost creators are unable to call `clawback`, resulting in all funds being locked in the incentives contract when a Boost is created.

### PoC

run in test/BoostCore.t.sol 

```solidity
    function testCreateBoost_Fund_Lock() public {
        // Create the Boost as alice
        address alice = address(1);
        vm.startPrank(alice);

        ABudget budget1 = _makeBudget(alice, authorized);
        mockERC20.mint(address(budget1), 200 ether);

        bytes memory validCreateCalldata1 = LibZip.cdCompress(
        abi.encode(
            BoostCore.InitPayload({
                budget: budget1,
                action: action,
                validator: BoostLib.Target({isBase: true, instance: address(0), parameters: ""}),
                allowList: allowList,
                incentives: _makeIncentives(1),
                protocolFee: 500, // 5%
                referralFee: 1000, // 10%
                maxParticipants: 10_000,
                owner: alice
            })
        )
        );
        BoostLib.Boost memory boost = boostCore.createBoost(validCreateCalldata1);
        assertEq(1, boost.incentives.length);
        ERC20Incentive _incentive = ERC20Incentive(address(boost.incentives[0]));
        vm.expectRevert(BoostError.Unauthorized.selector);
        _incentive.drawRaffle();
        vm.expectRevert(BoostError.Unauthorized.selector);
        _incentive.clawback(bytes(''));

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, the `BoostCore` contract should be updated to include explicit entry points that allow boost creators to call the `clawback` and `drawRaffle` functions or boost creators should be authorized in incentives contract to call these functions
