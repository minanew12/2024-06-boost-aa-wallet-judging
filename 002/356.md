# ERC20Incentive raffles can be gamed due to pseudorandomness

## Summary
ERC20Incentive raffle strategy uses pseudo randomness, users can compute the outcome of raffles and frontrun the drawRaffle function call to game raffles.
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can compute the outcome of raffles due to pseudorandomness used in raffles and frontrun the transaction of the owner to win raffles depending on the outcome. Note that users are able to sit on signatures as they do not include expiration.

```solidity
    function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
        if (strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();


        LibPRNG.PRNG memory _prng = LibPRNG.PRNG({state: block.prevrandao + block.timestamp});


        address winnerAddress = entries[_prng.next() % entries.length];


        asset.safeTransfer(winnerAddress, reward);
        emit Claimed(winnerAddress, abi.encodePacked(asset, winnerAddress, reward));
    }
```
If a user tries to take an entry in the raffle right before owner calls this function, an attacker can choose to place their entry before or after the user's to game the raffle. 

## Impact
Raffles can be gamed.
