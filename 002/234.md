# Ownership of Incentive Contracts by BoostRegistry prevents critical functions execution

## Summary
The `BoostRegistry` contract is the owner of the `Incentive` contracts, preventing users from reclaiming assets from the Incentive contract family or determining the winner for the raffle in the `ERC20Incentive` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `initialize` function of the `Incentive` contract family, the contract's owner is set to the `msg.sender`:

```Solidity
function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
    ...
=>  _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    ...
}
```
The `BoostRegistry::deployClone` function is used to deploy and initialize new contracts, including the Incentive contract family, through the `BoostLib::cloneAndInitialize` function, making the `BoostRegistry` contract the owner of the Incentive contracts.

[BoostRegistry::deployClone](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostRegistry.sol#L102-L120) function:
```Solidity
function deployClone(RegistryType type_, address base_, string calldata name_, bytes calldata data_)
    external
    nonReentrant
    returns (ACloneable instance)
{
    // Deploy and initialize the clone
=>  instance = ACloneable(base_.cloneAndInitialize(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(type_, base_, name_, msg.sender)), data_));
    ...
}
```

[BoostLib::cloneAndInitialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/shared/BoostLib.sol#L44-L48) function:
```Solidity
function cloneAndInitialize(address $, bytes32 salt_, bytes memory initData_) internal returns (address _clone) {
    _clone = $.cloneDeterministic(salt_);
=>  ACloneable(_clone).initialize(initData_);
}
```

As a result, certain functions in the Incentive contract family that require the owner role, such as `AIncentive::clawback` and `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle`, cannot be called. Since the `BoostRegistry` contract does not have any functions to call these owner-restricted functions, users are unable to reclaim assets or determine the raffle winner.

`AIncentive::clawback` function:
```Solidity
function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    ...
}
```

`ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle` function:
```Solidity
function drawRaffle() external override onlyOwner {
    ...
}
```

## Impact
- Assets cannot be reclaimed from the Incentive contracts
- The `ERC20Incentive` contract cannot determine the winner for the raffle
