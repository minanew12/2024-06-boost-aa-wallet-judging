# Unable to call some functions in the incentive contracts with onlyOwner modifier because of incorrect initialization leading to stuck funds

### Summary

`BoostCore.sol` will always be set as the owner of Boost provided incentive contracts because the initializer is called here within [_makeIncentives](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L266). Therefore any function using the onlyOwner modifier within the incentive contracts must be called by `BoostCore`. For example, there is no way to call [drawRaffle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L137) or [clawback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L98) from the BoostCore contract.

### Root Cause

[createBoost](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L106) is called to create a new boost. Each incentive is initialized by the call to [_makeIncentives](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L128). Within `_makeIncentives` the initializer is called for each incentive. The [initializer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L36C1-L53C6) function within each incentive contract sets the owner as msg.sender which would be the `BoostCore` contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Boost is created using the out of the box incentive contract as one of the incentives including: ERC20Incentive, CGDAIncentive, ERC20VariableIncentive, and ERC1155Incentive

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `createBoost` to create a new Boost
2. They choose to use an out of the box incentive contract listed above
3. They are initialized with `BoostCore` as the owner

### Impact

- No winner can be drawn for raffle contests through ERC20Incentive contract
- Any funds in the contract that need to be rescued cannot be retrieved through [clawback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L98)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Owner should be specified in the init payload by the user similarly to how its done for the budget contracts [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/SimpleBudget.sol#L54)
