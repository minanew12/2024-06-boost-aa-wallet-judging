# Missing functionality to clawback the incentives

### Summary

Missing functionality to clawback the incentives 

### Root Cause

`BoostCore` will always be the owner of all deployed incentives as they are the ones that will always initialize them:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L266-L291
```solidity
    /// @notice Configure a set of incentives for a Boost using the given ABudget
    /// @param targets_ The set of incentives {Target<AIncentive>[]}
    /// @param budget_ The ABudget from which to allocate the incentives
    /// @return incentives The set of initialized incentives {AIncentive[]}
    function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
        internal
        returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
    {
        incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
            // Deploy the clone, but don't initialize until it we've preflighted
            _checkTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);

            // Ensure the target is a base implementation (incentive clones are not reusable)
            if (!targets_[i].isBase) {
                revert BoostError.InvalidInstance(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);
            }

            incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], false));

            bytes memory preflight = incentives[i].preflight(targets_[i].parameters);
            if (preflight.length != 0) {
                // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
                assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
            }

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
            incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
        }
    }
```

But there is no functionality in `BoostCore` to clawback the incentives as they all have `onlyOwner` modifiers and are owned by `BoostCore`, leading to stuck funds if not all incentives are claimed.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L98
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc AIncentive
    function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        ...
    }
```
