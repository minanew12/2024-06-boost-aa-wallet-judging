# Incentives' clawback() function is uncallable

## Summary
Incentives' clawback() function cannot be called because of flawed logic

## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a Boost, the BoostCore contract sets up and initializes the incentives for a Boost through _makeIncentives() method. The incentives set the owner to be msg.sender in initialize() function, so the BoostCore contract becomes the "owner" of the incentive contract.
CGDAIncentive.sol, ERC1155Incentive.sol, ERC20Incentive.sol, ERC20VariableIncentive.sol have a function
clawback(), which has an onlyOwner() modifier. It is used when the owner wants to reclaim the assets that the incentive is holding. Because BoostCore is the owner and doesn't have logic to call this function, it becomes uncallable.

BoostCore.sol
```solidity
function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
        external
        canCreateBoost(msg.sender)
        nonReentrant
        returns (BoostLib.Boost memory)
    {
        ...
        boost.incentives = _makeIncentives(payload_.incentives, payload_.budget);
        ...
    }
```
```solidity
function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
        internal
        returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
    {
        incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
            ...
            incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], false));
            ...
            incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
        }
    }
```
ERC20VariableIncentive.sol
```solidity
function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
        ...
}
```
```solidity
function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
         ...
}
```
## Impact
Boosts' owners are not able to call clawback()

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add functionality that lets boosts' owners call clawback().
