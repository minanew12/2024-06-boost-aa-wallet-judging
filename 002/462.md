# `clawback` is not callable on provided incentive contracts because owner is set to BoostCore address

## Summary

The `clawback` function on the in scope incentive contracts has the `onlyOwner` modifier. Here is an example,

[CGDAIncentive.sol#L103-L112](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L103-L112)
```solidity
    function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external virtual override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload));
        (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));

        // Transfer the tokens back to the intended recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claim_.target, amount);
        emit Claimed(claim_.target, abi.encodePacked(asset, claim_.target, amount));

        return true;
    }
```

The problem is that all of the incentive contracts are initialized by `BoostCore` and set the owner to the BoostCore address. `BoostCore` does not contain any logic to call `clawback` on the incentives. This is a design issue that makes `clawback` uncallable for any of the provided incentive contracts.

## Impact

If users use the provided incentive contracts when they make a boost, they will not be able to call `clawback` and funds will not be retrievable from boost incentives. 

Consider if a boost is created with an action that is restricted by timestamps. For example, a user creates a boost to incentive minting an NFT during a certain period of time. If the NFT is unpopular and nobody decides to mint during that period, any funds sent to that boost incentive will be locked.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function testIncentiveClawbacksNotCallable() public {
        boostCore.createBoost(validCreateCalldata);
        assertEq(1, boostCore.getBoostCount());

        address myIncentive = address(boostCore.getBoost(0).incentives[0]);
        assertEq(boostCore.getBoost(0).owner, address(1));
        assertNotEq(address(1), Ownable(myIncentive).owner());
        assertEq(address(boostCore), Ownable(myIncentive).owner());
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The incentive owner should be set to be equal to the boost owner.
