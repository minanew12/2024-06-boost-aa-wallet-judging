# Creators of boosts can't withdraw the funds they deposit into boosts

### Summary

The main purpose of the boost protocol is to allow users to create different boosts with different incentive models, via the [createBoost()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L106-L144) function. The [createBoost()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L106-L144) function internally calls the [_makeIncentives()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L266-L291) function:

```solidity
    function _makeIncentives(BoostLib.Target[] memory targets_, ABudget budget_)
        internal
        returns (AIncentive[] memory incentives)
    {
        incentives = new AIncentive[](targets_.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
            // Deploy the clone, but don't initialize until it we've preflighted
            _checkTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);

            // Ensure the target is a base implementation (incentive clones are not reusable)
            if (!targets_[i].isBase) {
                revert BoostError.InvalidInstance(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);
            }

            incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], false));

            bytes memory preflight = incentives[i].preflight(targets_[i].parameters);
            if (preflight.length != 0) {
                // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
                assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
            }

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
            incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
        }
    }
```
As can be seen from the above code snippet the provided address for the contract has to be a base implementation not an already deployed clone of that implementation (Minimal Proxy). The ``BoostCore.sol`` contract will deploy a clone of the base implementation of the incentives contract that is provided as an argument. And will then become the owner of the Incentive contract. Let's take for example the ``ERC20Incentive.sol`` contract which is in scope for this audit. As we can see from the [ERC20Incentive::initialize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L36-L53) function:
```solidity
    function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
        InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));

        if (init_.reward == 0 || init_.limit == 0) revert BoostError.InvalidInitialization();

        // Ensure the maximum reward amount has been allocated
        uint256 maxTotalReward = init_.strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE ? init_.reward * init_.limit : init_.reward;
        uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (available < maxTotalReward) {
            revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, maxTotalReward);
        }

        asset = init_.asset;
        strategy = init_.strategy;
        reward = init_.reward;
        limit = init_.limit;
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    }
```
As we can see from the above code snippet the sender of the initialize call will become the owner of the contract, and as we can see from the [_makeIncentives()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L266-L291) function, the [ERC20Incentive::initialize(()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L36-L53) function is called thus the owner of the incentive contract will be the ``BoostCore.sol`` contract. Most of the incentives contract implementations provided by the boost protocol have a function that allows the creator of the incentive contract to withdraw an arbitrary amount of funds. In the ``ERC20Incentive.sol`` contract that function is the [clawback()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L98-L117) function. However the [clawback()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L98-L117) function has an **onlyOwner** modifier, and as described above the owner of the incentives contracts will  be the ``BoostCore.sol`` contract. In the ``BoostCore.sol`` contract the [clawback()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L98-L117) function is not implemented in any way, and thus funds from the incentives contracts can't be withdrawn by the creator of the boost. If there are some funds in the incentive contract and other users are no longer claiming, the creator of the incentive contract can't withdraw those funds and thus funds will be stuck in the contract.  
The incentive contracts that have a function that allows their creator to withdraw the funds in them, but the function has an **onlyOwner** modifier are the following:
- ``ERC20Incentive.sol``
- ``ERC20VariableIncentive.sol``
- ``ERC1155Incentive.sol``
- ``CGDAIncentive.sol``

### Root Cause

Most of the Incentive contracts implemented by the Boost protocol implement a function that allows the owner of the contract to withdraw an arbitrary amount of funds from the incentive contract. The owner of all incentive contracts deployed for a boost will be the ``BoostCore.sol`` contract, which doesn't have a functionality that allows the function that withdraws those tokens to be called.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The creator of the boost, won't be able to withdraw funds from the boost incentive contracts. If the users don't claim them the funds will be stuck in the contract forever. This will result in a loss for the boost creator.
