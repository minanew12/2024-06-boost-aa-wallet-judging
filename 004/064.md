# If the action instance is set as the `boost.validator`, an attacker can execute a DoS attack against the claimants

## Summary
User cannot claim the reward due to an unexpected `validate()` call failure.
## Vulnerability Detail
While calling `createBoost()`, if `payload_.validator.instance == address(0)` is true and the action contract supports `type(AValidator).interface`, it can be used to verify whether the caller is eligible to claim.

```solidity
    function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
        external
        canCreateBoost(msg.sender) // always pass
        nonReentrant
        returns (BoostLib.Boost memory)
    {
	...snip...

        // Setup the Boost components
        boost.action = AAction(_makeTarget(type(AAction).interfaceId, payload_.action, true));
        boost.validator = AValidator( // @audit come back? 
            payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
                ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) ? address(boost.action) : address(0)
                : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
        );
        ...snip...
    }
```

The only action instance that support interface of `type(AValidator).interfaceId` currently is ERC721MintAction(note that this contract isn't directly within the scope, but since BoostCore uses it for validation purposes, it's reasonable to consider it as part of BoostCore, which is within the scope). The action contract checks whether the claimants hold any `tokenId`; if so, it marks `validated[tokenId]` as `true` and proceeds with the claim. However, the validate() function lacks access controls which means an attacker can directly call it with a claimant's tokenId to set the `validated[tokenId]` status to `true`. 

This result in failure of `claimIncentive()` call in BoostCore, when the claimant later claims for the first time. 
 
## Impact
Claimants cannot claim their rewards.

## Recommendation
Add access control to action contract `validate()` function.
