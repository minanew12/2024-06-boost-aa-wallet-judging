# `Boostcore::createBoost` in a certain case would lead to the creation of "junk boosts" whereas it should have reverted in that case.

## Summary
`Boostcore::createBoost` in a certain case would lead to the creation of "junk boosts" whereas it should have reverted in that case. 
## Vulnerability Detail

When owner wants to create a new boost he will execute function `createBoost` -
```solidity
    function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
        external
        canCreateBoost(msg.sender)
        nonReentrant
        returns (BoostLib.Boost memory)
    {
        InitPayload memory payload_ = abi.decode(data_.cdDecompress(), (InitPayload));

        // Validate the Budget
        _checkBudget(payload_.budget);

        // Initialize the Boost
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts.push();
        boost.owner = payload_.owner;
        boost.budget = payload_.budget;
        boost.protocolFee = protocolFee + payload_.protocolFee;
        boost.referralFee = referralFee + payload_.referralFee;
        boost.maxParticipants = payload_.maxParticipants;

        // Setup the Boost components
        boost.action = AAction(_makeTarget(type(AAction).interfaceId, payload_.action, true));
        boost.allowList = AAllowList(_makeTarget(type(AAllowList).interfaceId, payload_.allowList, true));
@>        boost.incentives = _makeIncentives(payload_.incentives, payload_.budget);
        boost.validator = AValidator(
            payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
                ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) ? 
@>                address(boost.action) : address(0)
                : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
        );
        emit BoostCreated(
            _boosts.length - 1,
            boost.owner,
            address(boost.action),
            boost.incentives.length,
            address(boost.validator),
            address(boost.allowList),
            address(boost.budget)
        );
        return boost;
    }
```

Here in this function, the main issue leading to the creation of "junk boosts" will occur while setting the `validator` contract address for the boost. 
Let's examine it:
```solidity
        boost.validator = AValidator(
            payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
                ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) ? address(boost.action) : address(0)
                : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
        );
```
Ternary Operator Breakdown:
The following logic uses nested ternary operators (condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false) to decide the value.

- The outer Ternary -
```solidity
payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
    ? ...
    : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
```
This checks if the instance property of payload_.validator is the zero address (address(0)), which usually indicates an uninitialized or default address.

If true (address is 0): It proceeds to the INNER ternary:
```solidity
boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId)
    ? address(boost.action)
    : address(0)
```
Condition: `boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId)`

`boost.action.supportsInterface(...)` checks if the object `boost.action` supports the interface identified by AValidator. 
type(AValidator).interfaceId: This retrieves the interface ID (a bytes4 value) of the AValidator interface, used in interface detection.
If true: address(boost.action) is returned, meaning boost.validator will be set to the address of boost.action.

ISSUE HERE - If false: address(0) is returned, meaning boost.validator will be set to the zero address (no validator).

A boost, is not possible to work without the validator contract as it helps in validating the user specific "action". Therefore the `Boostcore::createBoost` will be successful in creating a boost that does not have any validator contract. This boost will be of no use and no one will use it due to not having proper validator contract. Leading this to creating a "Junk Boosts"

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In this type of case instead of setting it to address(0), directly revert the whole function, letting no "Junk boost" get created.
