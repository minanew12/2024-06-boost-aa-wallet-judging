# A zero address validator renders claiming impossible

### Summary

If the boost creator sets the address of `boost.validator` to 0 when creating a boost, claiming becomes impossible since the claim is validated by calling the `validate()` function of the `boost.validator`. Moreover, once the `boost.validator` is set to 0, it cannot be changed.

### Root Cause

As indicated in [BoostCore.sol:131](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet-davies0212/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L131), it is possible to set `boost.validator` to `address(0)` when creating a boost.

```solidity
    function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
        ...

        boost.validator = AValidator(
            payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
131             ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) ? address(boost.action) : address(0)
                : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
        );
        ...
```

In this case, the `claimIncentiveFor()` function will always revert, as the claiming process relies on the `validate()` function of `boost.validator`, which does not exist at `address(0)`, as noted in [BoostCore.sol:176](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet-davies0212/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L176).

Additionally, there is no way to modify the address of `boost.validator` once it has been set.

```solidity
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        ...

176     if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        ...
```
