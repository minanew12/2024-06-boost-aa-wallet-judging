# boost.validator can be set to address(0) causing it to be impossible for claims to be validated

### Summary

Boost.validator can be set to address(0) during the `BoostCore::createBoost` function call. As a result, no validations will be able to happen leading to a denial of service for the protocol in regards to validating incentive claims as there will be no validator to validate these incentives as it is assigned to address(0). 

### Root Cause

```solidity
boost.validator = AValidator(
            payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
                ? (boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) ? address(boost.action) : address(0))
                : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
        );
```

Under the condition that validator.instance isn't assigned, and that boost.action doesn't support the interface AValidator, boost.validator is assigned to the value address(0). 

This can cause significant later consequences as any actions that will be done for the purpose of meeting the requirements for the boost incentive will be unable to be rewarded as since the boost.validator doesn't exist - it is address(0) - there will be no validator to validate incentive claims through claimIncentiveFor() causing a loss of expected incentive rewards amongst boost users.

### Impact

Users who complete actions with the expectation of gaining their incentive rewards following their action completion will be unable to claim any rewards due to the inability for incentive claims to be validated as their will be no validator to do so. 

### PoC

My PoC is mostly just combining the other tests from EndToEndSigner.sol but the main difference is that the address of the instance for the validator is address(0). This test passes, which shows that we can create a boost with a validator of address 0, which would later cause later effects of boost users who complete actions of being unable to claim incentives.

function test_MaliciousCreatorCanCreateABoostWithAnAddress0Validator() public {
        registry.register(BoostRegistry.RegistryType.ACTION, "RandomContractThatImplementsAAction", address(new ARandomActionConractThatImplementsAAction()));

        _when_I_allocate_assets_to_my_budget(budget);

        (validatorSigner, validatorSignerKey) = makeAddrAndKey("SignerValidator Signer");
        address[] memory signers = new address[](1);
        
        // signers[0] = address(0);

        // "I can specify a list of allowed addresses"
        address[] memory denyList = new address[](2);

        BoostLib.Target[] memory incentives = new BoostLib.Target[](1);

                            )
                        }),
                        BoostLib.Target({
                            // "... and I can specify a SignerValidator to sign off on claims"
                            isBase: true,

                                )
                            ),
                            parameters: abi.encode(address(this), denyList)
                        }),
                        incentives, // "I can specify the incentive..."
                        1_000, // "I can specify an additional protocol fee" => 1,000 bps == 10%
                        500, // "I can specify an additional referral fee" => 500 bps == 5%
                        5, // "I can specify a maximum number of participants" => 5

                    )

            )
        );

        assertEq(address(boost.validator), address(0));
    }
```

### Mitigation

In the case that validator.instance isn't assigned (`validator.instance == address(0)`) and that the boost action doesn't support the AValidator interface, instead of setting boost.validator to address(0) the function call should revert.
