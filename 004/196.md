# BoostCore allows a new boost's validator to be set to address(0) which causes users to be unable to claim assets

### Summary

When `BoostCore::createBoost()` is called, if `payload_.validator` is set to `address(0)` and the action does not implement `AValidator`, `boost.validator` is set to `address(0)` which is unnecessary as `address(0)` is not a validator contract, this will cause `BoostCore::claimIncentive()` to revert if a user calls it as it tries to call `address(0).validator()` which doesn't exist. Instead, if the action does not implement `AValidator`, `BoostCore::createBoost()` should revert.

### Root Cause

In `BoostCore.sol:129` it sets validator to `address(0)` which causes `claimIncentive` to revert. This can be fixed incredibly easily by just adding a revert statement instead of `address(0)`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Boost Creator calls `createBoost` thinking that their action has implemented `AValidator`
2. boost.validator is set to `address(0)`
3. Now, no one can claim their incentives

### Impact

- Users can't claimIncentives
- Also their is no reason as to why `boost.validator` should be set to `address(0)`

### PoC

Add this to bottom of `BoostCore.t.sol`

```solidity
    function test_canValidatorBeSetToZero() public {
        AAction contractAction = new ContractAction();

        bytes memory addressZeroData = LibZip.cdCompress(
            abi.encode(
                BoostCore.InitPayload({
                    budget: budget,
                    action: BoostLib.Target(false, address(contractAction), ""),
                    validator: BoostLib.Target(false, address(0), ""),
                    allowList: allowList,
                    incentives: _makeIncentives(1),
                    protocolFee: 500, // 5%
                    referralFee: 1000, // 10%
                    maxParticipants: 10_000,
                    owner: address(1)
                })
            )
        );

        BoostLib.Boost memory boost = boostCore.createBoost(addressZeroData);

        assertEq(address(boost.validator), address(0));
    }
```

### Mitigation

Change `address(0)` to a revert statement
