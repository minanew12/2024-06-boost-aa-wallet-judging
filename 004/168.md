# Users unable to claim rewards due to invalid Validator assignment in BoostCore contract

## Summary

The BoostCore contract contains a potential DoS vulnerability when the validator address is set to `address(0)`. In cases where the validator is incorrectly assigned as `address(0)`, calls to validate user claims will revert, preventing users from claiming their rewards. This issue becomes critical as the validator address cannot be changed once set, making the DoS permanent.

## Vulnerability Detail

When creating a Boost, the contract assigns a validator by checking if the `validator.instance` is `address(0)`. If it is, the contract either assigns the validator to the action (if it supports the `AValidator` interface) or sets it to `address(0)`.

[BoostCore#L129-L133](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L129-L133)
```solidity
    function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
        external
        canCreateBoost(msg.sender)
        nonReentrant
        returns (BoostLib.Boost memory)
    {
        ...
        boost.validator = AValidator(
            payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
 @>             ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) ? address(boost.action) : address(0)
                : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
        );
        ...
```

In the `claimIncentiveFor` function, the Boost contract attempts to validate user claims by calling `boost.validator.validate()`. However, if `boost.validator` is set to `address(0)`, the contract will revert when trying to call the `validate` function on the zero address. This creates a situation where users are permanently unable to claim their rewards, effectively causing a DoS.

[BoostCore#L176](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L176)
```solidity
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, function is nonReentrant)
 @>     if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        ...
```

## Impact

This vulnerability leads to a permanent DoS for users attempting to claim rewards from a Boost. Since the validator cannot be modified after Boost creation, any Boost created under these circumstances will forever prevent users from claiming their incentives, potentially resulting in the loss of user funds.

## Recommendation

In the Boost protocol, validators are intended to be external (i.e., smart contracts that validate whether a user has performed the required Boost action), or the actions themselves can serve as validators. Therefore, if the Boost creator attempts to create a Boost with an action that does not support `type(AValidator).interfaceId`, the Boost should not be created with the validator set to `address(0)`; instead, the transaction should revert.

Example Fix: 

```diff
    function createBoost(bytes calldata data_)
        external
        canCreateBoost(msg.sender)
        nonReentrant
        returns (BoostLib.Boost memory)
    {
        ...
        boost.validator = AValidator(
            payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
                ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) ? address(boost.action) : address(0)
                : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)

+       if(address(boost.validator) == address(0)) revert InvalidValidatorParam();
        );
```
