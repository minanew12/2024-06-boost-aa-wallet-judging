# Initializing a boost with `payload_.validator.instance = address(0)` will cause `claimIncentiveFor` is unusable and loss of funds in the incentive contract

### Summary

Initializing a boost with `payload_.validator.instance = address(0)` will cause `claimIncentiveFor` is unusable and loss of funds in the incentive contract.

### Root Cause

When a user creates a boost, they can set `payload_.validator.instance` to `address(0)`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L129-L133

```solidity
        boost.validator = AValidator(
            payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
>>              ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) ? address(boost.action) : address(0)
                : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
        );
```

Since the `EventAction` contract, which is the only in-scope action, is not implemented `AValidator`, `boost.validator` will be set to `address(0)`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user creates a boost with `payload_.validator.instance = address(0)`
2. The function `claimIncentiveFor` always revert due to `boost.validator = address(0)`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L176

```solidity
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, function is nonReentrant)
>>      if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```

### Impact

- The function `claimIncentiveFor` is unusable
- In the initialization, the funds from the budget was transferred to the incentive contracts. Since the function `claimIncentiveFor` is unusable, the funds can not be distributed to the users. Moreover, due to a bug in the initialization of the incentive contracts, which is submitted in a different issue, the `clawback` function in the incentive contract is also unusable, the boost creator can not reclaim back the funds in the incentive contracts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

During a boost initialization, revert if `boost.validator = address(0)`.
