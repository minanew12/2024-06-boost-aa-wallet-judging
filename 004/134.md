# Incorrect Validator Assignment in BoostCore Contract Due to Unsupported Interface Check

## Summary
The BoostCore contract contains an issue in the way it assigns the validator component (`boost.validator`) for a Boost. Specifically, it checks whether the `boost.action` component supports the `AValidator` interface. However, `boost.action` is assigned to an `AAction` type, which does not implement or have a `supportsInterface` function for the `AValidator` interface. This results in the condition `boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId)` always returning false. The problem may lead to an unintended assignment of the `validator`, causing logical inconsistencies and potential functionality failures.



## Vulnerability Detail
The logic in the following part of the `createBoost` function is flawed:

```solidity
boost.validator = AValidator(
    payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
        ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) ? address(boost.action) : address(0)
        : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
);
```

1. `boost.action` is initialized with an `AAction` type:
```solidity
    boost.action = AAction(_makeTarget(type(AAction).interfaceId, payload_.action, true));
```

2. Later, the code attempts to check if `boost.action` supports the `AValidator` interface, but `AAction` does not implement `supportsInterface` for `AValidator`: 

[AAction.sol#L33-L35](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/actions/AAction.sol#L33-L35)
```solidity
abstract contract AAction is ACloneable {
    ...
    /// @inheritdoc ACloneable
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override(ACloneable) returns (bool) {
ðŸ‘‰       return interfaceId == type(AAction).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
}
```

making this check invalid. Therefore, the following condition will always be `false`. This leads to setting `boost.validator` to address(0) in cases where validation might be required from `boost.action`.

```solidity
   boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId)
```

## Impact
- **Incorrect Validator Assignment**: This issue results in the `validator` being assigned as `address(0)` when the action does not implement the `AValidator` interface. This could cause several functionalities related to validation to fail, particularly in use cases where validation should be handled by the action.
  
- **Possible Logic Breakage**: Any function relying on validation (e.g., `claimIncentive`) will be affected, and users may not be able to perform actions that require validation due to this incorrect assignment.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
boost.validator = AValidator(
    payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
        ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) ? address(boost.action) : address(0)
        : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review 


## Recommendation
In cases where the Boost creator does not provide a validator address, and the action can be self-validated, `boost.action` should be cast to an interface designed for actions capable of self-validation, rather than the `AAction` type. The contract design should be updated to support this functionality.
