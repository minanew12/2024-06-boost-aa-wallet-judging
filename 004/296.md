# Incentive Claim Fails Due to Validator Set to address(0)

## Summary
In the createBoost() function, if an action does not support the validator interface or does not require validation, the validator is set to address(0). However, during the incentive claim process, the protocol still attempts to validate the claim. Since the validator is set to address(0), the claim reverts, preventing users from claiming their incentives.

## Vulnerability Detail
The createBoost() function sets the validator based on the action's support for the AValidator interface:
```solidity
boost.validator = AValidator(
    payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
        ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) 
            ? address(boost.action) 
            : address(0)
        : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
);
```
If the action does not support the interface or does not require validation, the boost.validator is assigned address(0).

However, when claiming the incentive in the claimIncentiveFor() function, the protocol checks for validation:
```solidity
if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

```
If the validator is address(0), the validation call will revert, making it impossible for the user to claim their incentive.

## Impact
This bug blocks users from claiming their rightful incentives, leading to a failure in functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that if validation is not required, the validation step in claimIncentiveFor() is bypassed, or add a condition to prevent setting the validator to address(0) if validation is expected.
