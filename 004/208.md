# Claiming Would Always Revert For A Certain Type Of Boosts

## Summary

Inside BoostCore we can see when a validator is being assigned it can be a SignerValidator , the action itself if it supports validation , or it will be the 0 address , therefore it is permitted that the validator is indeed empty (the boost creator wants some kind of boost where the first 50 users who claims gets the incentive irrespective of validations , kind of a limited airdrop)

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) When a user creates a boost as described above this is how it is done in the code ->

2.) When a user claims for such boost ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L129

it will always revert because of the check ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L176

because there exists no validator . Therefore the incentives can not be claimed for such boosts.


## Impact

Incentives for such boost can not be claimed .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a try catch in case the validator is a 0 address.
