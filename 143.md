# Ownable contracts can be used to bypass soulbound feature

## Summary
The soulbound feature of the `Points` token can be bypassed if tokens are issued to an ownable smart contract, allowing ownership of tokens to be transferred.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Points` token introduces soulbound functionality to ensure that token transfers automatically revert:

```solidity
    /// @notice A hook that is called before any transfer of points
    /// @dev Reverts if the transfer is not a mint or burn (i.e. if neither `from` nor `to` are the zero address)
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256) internal virtual override {
        if (from != address(0) && to != address(0)) revert NonTransferable();
    }
```

These tokens are minted directly to users by a trusted role (used in the `PointsIncentive` contract): 

```solidity
    function issue(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ISSUER_ROLE) {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
```

However, there is no restriction on the destination for minting tokens. As a result, tokens could be minted to an ownable smart contract, which would enable transfer of ownership to someone else, and thus essentially enable transfer of the tokens.

## Impact
The code is not to specification as `Points` tokens can effectively be transferred through a loophole.

## Recommendation
Consider requiring the user to sign a message off-chain which is verified on-chain to ensure it is not a smart contract.
