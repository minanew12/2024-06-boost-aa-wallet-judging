# Weird ERC 20 issues

## Summary
There are lots of issues with supporting weird erc 20 issues in this report i am reported them all
- Precision loss due to supporting huge decimal tokens like YAMV2 
-  Rebasing and Fee-on transfer leading to loss of funds
- Blacklists containing tokens leading to DOS
-  Tokens like cUSDCv3 leading to niche cases of issues
- Tokens like COMP leading to more reverts of txns 
## Vulnerability Detail
#### Precision loss due to supporting huge decimal tokens like YAMV2 
In `ERC20VariableIncentive#claim()` during the calculation amount of [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20VariableIncentive.sol#L72) 
```solidity
...
        } else {
            // NOTE: this is assuming that the signed scalar is in ETH decimal format
            claimAmount = reward * signedAmount / 1e18;
        }
....
``` 
if the signed amount is of tokens like YAMV2 which are of 24 decimal places it will lead to a decimal precison loss of 6 digits which can easily compile to a huge amount considering a boost pays incentives in this token.

#### Rebasing and Fee-on transfer leading to loss of funds
As there are no balance checks in any incentive claim function this could lead to loss of funds for various users and even admin himself if he decides to clawback at the rebasing time.
#### Blacklists containing tokens leading to DOS
Tokens like USDC/USDT contains a blacklist which simply doesnt allow txns to be recieved by certain addresses leading to reversion of txn if due to any reason any address gets blacklisted 
#### Tokens like cUSDCv3 leading to niche cases of issues
- tokens like  cUSDCv3) contain a special case for amount == type(uint256).max in their transfer functions that result in only the user's balance being transferred.
In `managedbudget.sol` if owner decides to clawback the whole amount this will lead to issues

#### Tokens like COMP leading to more reverts of txns 
COMP reverts if the amount is more than uint96
