# Allowlist Not Checked In AContractAction

## Summary

There exists an allowlist when a boost is created , it defines all who can perform the action on the boost. But this allowlist is not checked in the AContractAction which holds the execute function.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) A boost is created and an allowlist is provided for the boost which acts like a whitelist for the boost ->

This can either be a allowlist or a deny list (blacklisted addresses)

2.) Imagine Alice was blacklisted for the above boost , but she can still perform the action ( contract action , moreover there is no such check in any action like EventAction ) , this is because in the AContractAction there is no check if Alice is in the blacklist or not ->

## Impact

Blacklisted users can perform actions and claim incentives.
