# Replay Attack Vulnerability from Insufficient Incentive Hashing

## Summary
The current implementation for hash calculation in the incentive claim process fails to uniquely identify each incentive within a Boost. This oversight leads to a scenario where only one incentive can be claimed per Boost, regardless of how many valid incentives exist. The issue can result in significant financial losses for users and potential denial-of-service attacks.
Sure, how about:

## Vulnerability Details

### Problem
The hash used for replay protection does not distinguish between different incentives within the same Boost. Specifically:

**Current Code**:
```solidity
bytes32 hash = hashSignerData(boostId, validatorData.incentiveQuantity, claimant, claim.incentiveData);
```

**Scenario**:
- A Boost with ID `100` contains 3 incentives (IDs `0`, `1`, `2`).
- Alice claims incentive `0`.
- The hash is computed using `boostId` (100) and `incentiveQuantity` (3).
- This hash is marked as used after Alice's claim.
- Bob attempts to claim incentive `1` of the same Boost.
- The hash for Bob’s claim is the same as Alice’s because the `boostId` and `incentiveQuantity` are identical.
- Since the hash is marked as used, Bob's transaction reverts.

**Impact**:
- Only one incentive can be claimed per Boost, effectively turning a multi-incentive Boost into a single-incentive Boost.
- Users are unable to claim their rightful incentives, leading to potential financial losses.
- The system may be exploited to block all incentives by claiming a low-value incentive.

## Impact
- Restricts claims to only one per Boost, regardless of the number of valid incentives.

## Mitigation

1. **Include `incentiveId` in Hash Calculation**:
   - Modify the hash calculation to include the specific `incentiveId` to ensure each claim is uniquely identifiable.
