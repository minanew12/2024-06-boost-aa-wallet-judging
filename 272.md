# reward in `ERC1155Incentive` is not initialized

## Summary
The `ERC1155Incentive` contract is intended to be initializable. However, the `reward` variable is assigned within the constructor. As a result, it will be initialized within the implementation storage, leaving the proxy storage unaffected.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `reward` variable is initialized in the constructor. It's even stated that the contract is a base implementation that should not be initialized through the constuctor.

```solidity
    /// @dev Because this contract is a base implementation, it should not be initialized through the constructor. Instead, it should be cloned and initialized using the {initialize} function.
    constructor() {
        reward = 1;
        _disableInitializers();
    }
```

## Impact
The `ERC1155Incentive` is currently broken; no claims can proceed. Additionally, `reward` cannot be updated elsewhere. The ERC1155 tokens inside the contract can still be retrieved by admin, but the functionality is fundamentally broken as users will not be able to claim despite passing verification elsewhere.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize `reward` in the initializer, not the constructor.
