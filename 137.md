# Reward Loss Due to External Contract Malfunction

### Summary

The lack of proper validation in the venue contract during the claim process will cause a potential loss of rewards for claimants, as the venue contract may fail to transfer rewards due to a bug or exploit. This would result in the user losing their expected rewards while the state is updated to reflect a successful claim.

### Root Cause

In [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/PointsIncentive.sol#L48), the `venue.call()` function is used without ensuring that the venue contract correctly handles the reward transfer. If the venue contract is destroyed the reward transfer can fail silently, leaving the user without the claimed rewards.

### Internal pre-conditions

* The owner calls the `claim()` function to set the claim state for a user.
* The `claimed[claimTarget]` is set to `true`, and the state is updated.
* The venue contract is set to a malfunctioning or malicious contract that fails to transfer rewards.

### External pre-conditions

The venue contract is destroyed and  prevent reward transfers.
The `venue.call()` fails, but no error is propagated back to the `claim()` function.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The claimants suffer a complete loss of rewards as the venue contract fails to transfer tokens. The claim state is updated to reflect success, but no rewards are received. After the state is updated the user address cant claim again during the `_isClaimable` check

### Mitigation

Validate the `venue` contract before calling `venue.call()` by checking whether it is a valid contract
