# Use of `require` or `if + revert` instead of `assert` for Dynamic Condition Validation in `_makeIncentives` Function



## Summary

In the `_makeIncentives` function, the use of `assert` for handling external dynamic conditions (like the failure of `budget_.disburse(preflight)`) is inappropriate. `assert` should be reserved for internal logic errors, and misusing it can lead to gas wastage and debugging difficulties. To improve error handling and gas efficiency, replacing `assert` with `require` or `if + revert` is recommended.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_makeIncentives` function in the `BoostCore.sol` contract is responsible for distributing incentives. The function checks whether `preflight.length != 0` and handles the failure of `budget_.disburse(preflight)` using an `assert` statement.

However, `assert` should only be used to check internal logic errors that should never fail, such as integer overflows or array out-of-bounds errors. When `assert` is misused for validating user input or checking external conditions, it can lead to frequent triggering of `assert` failures, resulting in wasted resources. These are predictable dynamic conditions, not logical errors.

When `assert` fails, it consumes all remaining gas and rolls back the transaction. This means that when `assert` detects an error, the contract execution halts and reverts, and all gas paid by the caller is consumed, causing the transaction to fail. This is particularly important in complex contracts, where multiple operations are involved, and a failure at any point could result in significant gas loss for the user.

Moreover, `assert` does not provide custom error messages. When it fails, it doesn’t offer any details about the error, making it harder for developers or users to identify the root cause. In contrast, `require` or `if + revert` can return custom error messages, making issues easier to diagnose and fix.

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets_.length; i++) {
            // Deploy the clone, but don't initialize until it we've preflighted
            _checkTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);

            // Ensure the target is a base implementation (incentive clones are not reusable)
            if (!targets_[i].isBase) {
                revert BoostError.InvalidInstance(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i].instance);
            }

            incentives[i] = AIncentive(_makeTarget(type(AIncentive).interfaceId, targets_[i], false));

            bytes memory preflight = incentives[i].preflight(targets_[i].parameters);
            if (preflight.length != 0) {
                // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
@audit=>        assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
            }

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, entrypoint is nonReentrant)
            incentives[i].initialize(targets_[i].parameters);
        }
    }

```

## Impact

- User Frustration: Users may experience unexpected transaction failures without understanding why, as `assert` does not provide helpful feedback.
- Gas Wastage: Misuse of `assert` results in all remaining gas being consumed upon failure, leading to inefficient and costly transactions.
- Lack of Error Clarity: Debugging is more difficult due to the absence of custom error messages, making it challenging to identify the failure’s cause.

## Recommendation

Replace `assert` with `require` or `if + revert` in the `_makeIncentives` function when handling the failure of `budget_.disburse(preflight)`. This approach will allow for dynamic condition checks, provide meaningful error messages, and prevent unnecessary gas consumption when a transaction fails due to predictable conditions.
