# Inheritance Order Causes Interface Validation to Fail in AERC721MintAction

# Title: Inheritance Order Causes Interface Validation to Fail in AERC721MintAction

## Summary
The `supportsInterface` function in `AERC721MintAction` does not behave as intended due to Solidityâ€™s inheritance resolution using the [C3 Linearization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization). As a result, the `AValidator`'s `supportsInterface` function is never called, which prevents the correct validation of interfaces in certain actions that rely on self-validation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue occurs in the following code:

```solidity
boost.validator = AValidator(
    payload_.validator.instance == address(0)
        ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) 
          ? address(boost.action) : address(0)
        : _makeTarget(type(AValidator).interfaceId, payload_.validator, true)
);
```

In actions like `AERC721MintAction`, validation is intended to be handled within the action itself, meaning the `validator` should be set to the action's address. This is determined by the check:

```solidity
payload_.validator.instance == address(0) 
    ? boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId) 
      ? address(boost.action) 
      : address(0)
```

However, the call to `boost.action.supportsInterface(type(AValidator).interfaceId)` does not behave as expected due to Solidity's inheritance order in `AERC721MintAction`, which is:

```solidity
[AERC721MintAction, AContractAction, AAction, ACloneable, ERC165, AValidator, Initializable]
```

When `boost.action.supportsInterface` is called, the inheritance chain traverses through `AERC721MintAction`, `AContractAction`, `AAction`, `ACloneable`, and stops at `ERC165`. Because `ERC165` does not call `super.supportsInterface` but instead directly returns a value, thus the call never reaches `AValidator`'s `supportsInterface` function. This causes the validation to return `false`, and the validator is incorrectly set to `address(0)` instead of the action's address, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.

## Impact
By not properly detecting that the action supports self-validation, the contract fails to set the correct validator address. This could lead to improper validation logic being applied, and as a result, certain actions may not perform as expected, affecting the overall functionality and security of the contract.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L129-L133


Due to the inheritance order, the `supportsInterface` function of `AValidator` is never called, causing the check to always return `false`.

## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, modify the inheritance order in `AERC721MintAction.sol` so that `AValidator` is inherited before `AContractAction`.
