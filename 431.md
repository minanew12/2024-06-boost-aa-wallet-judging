# incentive owners can change the limit to zero at any period

## Summary
In `ERC20Incentives` & `ERC20VariableIncentive` owner can change the limit to zero after initialization at any period.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `ERC20Incentive.sol` there is no check that makes sure the amount is not more than `limit`
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc AIncentive
    function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        //
        ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload)); 
        (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));

        if (strategy == Strategy.RAFFLE) {
            // Ensure the amount is the full reward and there are no raffle entries, then reset the limit
            if (amount != reward || claims > 0) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));
            limit = 0;
        } else {
            // Ensure the amount is a multiple of the reward and reduce the max claims accordingly
            if (amount % reward != 0) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_));
            limit -= amount / reward;
        }

        // Transfer the tokens back to the intended recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claim_.target, amount);
        emit Claimed(claim_.target, abi.encodePacked(asset, claim_.target, amount));

        return true;
    }
```
this same scenario occurs in `ERC20VariableIncentive` 
```solidity
    function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload));
        (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));

        limit -= amount;

        // Transfer the tokens back to the intended recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claim_.target, amount);
        emit Claimed(claim_.target, abi.encodePacked(asset, claim_.target, amount));

        return true;
    }
```
Now after discussing real functionality of `CLAWBACK` with the sponsors it was found out :

Now as per the sponsor this seems to be like a design choice but here lies one flaw i.e boost creator can give incentives to certain users and then change the limit to zero leading to a scenario where other users couldnot claim while they were in the process of completing the boost action.
### POC
<details markdown='1'><summary>Paste this test in ManagedBudget.t.sol</summary> 

```solidity
 function testClawback_ERC1155_limitzero() public {
        // Approve the budget to transfer tokens
        mockERC1155.setApprovalForAll(address(managedBudget), true);

        // Allocate 100 of token ID 42 to the budget
        bytes memory data = abi.encode(
            ABudget.Transfer({
                assetType: ABudget.AssetType.ERC1155,
                asset: address(mockERC1155),
                target: address(this),
                data: abi.encode(ABudget.ERC1155Payload({tokenId: 42, amount: 100, data: ""}))
            })
        );
        managedBudget.allocate(data);
        assertEq(managedBudget.available(address(mockERC1155), 42), 100);

        // Reclaim all of token ID 42 from the budget
        data= _makeERC1155Transfer(address(mockERC1155), address(this), 42, 0, "");

        assertTrue(managedBudget.clawback(data));

        // Ensure the budget has 1 of token ID 42 left
        assertEq(managedBudget.available(address(mockERC1155), 42), 0);
    }

```

Run:   `forge test --match-path test/budgets/ManagedBudget.t.sol --match-test testClawback_ERC1155_limitzero`

## Impact
Some users will get more benefit other than the other creating a centralized ecosystem for some users where they always end up not earning any incentives

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- create a check that doesnt allow boost creator to not claim instantly if there some claimants already claimed
- create a limit check
This will ensure that boost creators can also clawback instantly but also not practice any blackhanded methods
