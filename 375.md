# Arithmetic Underflow Vulnerability in Clawback Function Due to Insufficient Limit Check

## Summary
The [clawback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20VariableIncentive.sol#L98) function  does not properly validate that the amount being clawed back does not exceed the available limit. This oversight allows the function to reduce the limit below zero, leading to an arithmetic underflow, which was confirmed during testing.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the lack of a check to ensure that the `amount` being clawed back is less than or equal to the current `limit`. Specifically, the function directly subtracts `amount` from `limit` without validating that `limit` is sufficient. As a result, if `amount` exceeds `limit`, an arithmetic underflow occurs, which reverts the transaction with a generic panic error (0x11) instead of the expected custom error (BoostError.ClaimFailed).
## Impact
* The arithmetic underflow caused by exceeding the limit will revert the transaction, preventing further actions.
* Instead of throwing a custom error `(BoostError.ClaimFailed)`, the function reverts with a panic error due to the underflow, which could confuse users or integrators regarding the nature of the failure.
* In scenarios where underflow is unchecked, incorrect contract states can lead to unintended consequences, including failure to enforce limits correctly.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload));
        (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));

        limit -= amount; <---

        // Transfer the tokens back to the intended recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claim_.target, amount);
        emit Claimed(claim_.target, abi.encodePacked(asset, claim_.target, amount));

        return true;
    }
```
## PoC
```solidity
 function testClawbackExceedsLimit() public {
        // Step 1: Set up the mock token and initialize the incentive contract with a limit
        uint256 initialLimit = 50 ether; // Let's set the limit to 50 tokens (assuming 18 decimals)
        uint256 reward = 1 ether; // Set the reward to 1 token (also in 18 decimals)

        // Initialize the contract with a mock asset, reward, and limit
        bytes memory initPayload = abi.encode(InitPayload({
            asset: address(mockAsset),
            reward: reward,
            limit: initialLimit
        }));
        incentive.initialize(initPayload);

        // Step 2: Try to claw back more than the limit
        uint256 excessiveAmount = 60 ether; // Exceeds the limit of 50 tokens

        // Prepare the ClawbackPayload with the excessive amount
        ClawbackPayload memory clawbackPayload = ClawbackPayload({
            target: address(this),  // Target recipient for the clawback
            data: abi.encode(excessiveAmount)
        });
        bytes memory clawbackData = abi.encode(clawbackPayload);

        // Expect a revert when clawback is called with an excessive amount
        vm.expectRevert(BoostError.ClaimFailed.selector); // Expected revert reason
        incentive.clawback(clawbackData);

        // Step 3: Perform a valid clawback within the limit
        uint256 validAmount = 20 ether; // Within the limit

        // Prepare the ClawbackPayload with the valid amount
        ClawbackPayload memory validClawbackPayload = ClawbackPayload({
            target: address(this),  // Target recipient for the clawback
            data: abi.encode(validAmount)
        });
        bytes memory validClawbackData = abi.encode(validClawbackPayload);

        // Call clawback with the valid amount
        bool success = incentive.clawback(validClawbackData);
        assertTrue(success, "Valid clawback should succeed");

        // Verify the remaining limit has decreased
        uint256 expectedRemainingLimit = initialLimit - validAmount;
        assertEq(incentive.limit(), expectedRemainingLimit, "Limit should be decreased after valid clawback");

        // Verify that the tokens were transferred correctly
        uint256 recipientBalance = mockAsset.balanceOf(address(this));
        assertEq(recipientBalance, validAmount, "Recipient should receive the valid clawback amount");
    }

[FAIL. Reason: Error != expected error: panic: arithmetic underflow or overflow (0x11) != custom error 4139d81d:]
```

## Recommendation
```solidity
/// @inheritdoc AIncentive
    function clawback(bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        ClawbackPayload memory claim_ = abi.decode(data_, (ClawbackPayload));
        (uint256 amount) = abi.decode(claim_.data, (uint256));
        if (amount > limit) revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, abi.encode(claim_)); <--- add this check
        limit -= amount;

        // Transfer the tokens back to the intended recipient
        asset.safeTransfer(claim_.target, amount);
        emit Claimed(claim_.target, abi.encodePacked(asset, claim_.target, amount));

        return true;
    }
