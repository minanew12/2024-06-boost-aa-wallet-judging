# CGDAIncentive Contract Initialization Flaws: Reward Exhaustion Risk

## Summary
In the initialization logic of the Continuous Gradual Dutch Auction (CGDA) Incentive contract. Specifically, the `initialize` function does not check if `totalBudget` is equal to `initialReward`, which could lead to reward exhaustion after the first claim, and it also lacks a check to ensure that `rewardDecay` is less than `initialReward`. These issues can lead to reward exhaustion or unintended contract behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail
# Case: 1
In the `initialize` function, there is a condition ensuring that `totalBudget` is greater than `initialReward`. 
```solidity
     function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
        InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));

        uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (available < init_.totalBudget) {
            revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, init_.totalBudget);
        }

        if (
            init_.initialReward == 0 || init_.rewardDecay == 0 || init_.rewardBoost == 0
@>              || init_.totalBudget < init_.initialReward
        ) revert BoostError.InvalidInitialization();

        asset = init_.asset;
        cgdaParams = CGDAParameters({
            rewardDecay: init_.rewardDecay,
            rewardBoost: init_.rewardBoost,
            lastClaimTime: block.timestamp,
            currentReward: init_.initialReward
        });

        totalBudget = init_.totalBudget;
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    }

```
However, the contract does not account for cases where `totalBudget` is exactly equal to `initialReward`. If this situation occurs, the contract will have no remaining budget after the first claim, as the reward will deplete the total budget completely.

If `init_.totalBudget == init_.initialReward`, **no decay can happen after the first claim, as there would be no remaining budget to accommodate future claims**. This prevents the reward decay mechanism from functioning as intended, rendering the incentive ineffective for future claims, Additionally, the contract does not check if `rewardDecay` is greater than or equal to `initialReward`.

                    asset: address(asset),
                    initialReward: 10 ether, //@audit set the initialReward equal to totalBudget for testing purpose
                    rewardDecay: 0.05 ether,
                    rewardBoost: 0.1 ether,
                    totalBudget: 10 ether
                })
            )
        );

        // Two participants for the incentive claim process
        address participant1 = makeAddr("participant1");
        address participant2 = makeAddr("participant2");

        // First participant claims the entire initial reward (10 ether)
        incentive.claim(participant1, hex"");

        // Check that participant1 has received the full reward (10 ether)
        assertEq(asset.balanceOf(participant1), 10 ether);

        // Expect the second participant to revert due to insufficient budget
        // @audit after the first claim, no remaining budget for further claims
        vm.expectRevert();
        incentive.claim(participant2, hex"");
    }
```

# Case: 2
In the [currentReward()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L123-L131) function, the reward decays after each claim, and the `projectedReward` increases based on the time elapsed since the last claim, boosted by the `rewardBoost` parameter. If `init_.rewardDecay` exceeds `init_.initialReward`, reward decays too quickly and becomes zero, the reward boost (rewardBoost) thatâ€™s supposed to increase the reward over time will no longer be effective. No matter how long a user waits between claims, the reward might remain zero or very low.

                    initialReward: 1 ether,
                    rewardDecay: 2 ether, //@audit set the rewardDecay greater than initialReward for testing purpose
                    rewardBoost: 0.1 ether,
                    totalBudget: 3 ether
                })
            )
        );

        // Two participants for the incentive claim process
        address participant1 = makeAddr("participant1");
        address participant2 = makeAddr("participant2");
        address participant3 = makeAddr("participant3");

        // First claim: participant1 claims the incentive
        // Reward will be 1 ether (initialReward)
        incentive.claim(participant1, hex"");

        // Second claim: participant2 claims the incentive
        // Reward will be 2 ether (due to the excessive decay)
        incentive.claim(participant2, hex"");

        // Third claim: participant3 tries to claim, but the contract should revert
        // due to no remaining reward or incentive budget left (reward has decayed to 0).
        vm.expectRevert();
        incentive.claim(participant3, hex"");
    }
```
Run the following command to execute the POC:`forge test --mt test_claimWithExcessiveDecay`

## Impact
If the `totalBudget` is set equal to the `initialReward`, the contract will be unable to process any claims beyond the first. This can lead to a failure of the reward distribution mechanism, as participants will not receive any further rewards after the initial claim. 

If `init_.rewardDecay` exceeds `init_.initialReward`, the reward could be reduced to zero or negative values after a claim, which would negatively affect future reward calculations.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add explicit checks in the initialize function:

```diff
  function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
        InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));

        uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (available < init_.totalBudget) {
            revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, init_.totalBudget);
        }

        if (
            init_.initialReward == 0 || init_.rewardDecay == 0 || init_.rewardBoost == 0
+                || init_.totalBudget <= init_.initialReward || init_.rewardDecay >= init_.initialReward 
        ) revert BoostError.InvalidInitialization();

        asset = init_.asset;
        cgdaParams = CGDAParameters({
            rewardDecay: init_.rewardDecay,
            rewardBoost: init_.rewardBoost,
            lastClaimTime: block.timestamp,
            currentReward: init_.initialReward
        });

        totalBudget = init_.totalBudget;
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    }

```
