# Managers and admin can never disburse

## Summary
The role of the manager is to deposit funds i.e. calling disburse to send funds (ERC20, ETH, ERC1155) to users. But the implementation doesn't allow to call it, breaking the core contract functionality. Disburse is called by `BOOST contract` during the boost creation. And, this boost creation checks if it is authorized to call it, so the boost creator might receive the manager role, but he can never create the boost because it will revert on the [disburse call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L283-L286).

Likelihood: always
Impact: Admin or manager can never disburse the funds, breaking the functionality of the role. And in cases where, manager should be authorized to call boost disburse and prefight is there, then disburse reverts leading to the boost creation failure. So High.


## Vulnerability Detail

Disburse can be called by either owner or admin or manager, according to the code @notice tags and the implementation also says so. Look at L133. 

ADMIN_ROLE = 1 << 0 = 1
MANAGER_ROLE = 1 << 1 = 2

But ADMIN_ROLE | MANAGER_ROLE = 1 | 2 = 3, so roles 3 belongs to neither admin nor the manager. Their roles are 1 and 2 respectively. so the  team implements the `or` mechanism here, but it will revert if a manager or admin calls disburse. Because 3 is not owned by them.

It should eb like  `isOwner || has role(admin) || has role(manager)`

```

## Impact
Admin or manager can never disburse the funds, breaking the functionality of the role. And in cases where, manager should be authorized to call boost disburse and prefight is there, then disburse reverts leading to the boost creation failure. So High.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a new modifier that check if the caller is either owner or the caller has admin roles (1) or manager roles(2).
