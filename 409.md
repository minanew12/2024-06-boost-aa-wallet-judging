# Potential for Action Replay

## Details

The Boost protocol uses the AAction contract and its descendants, such as AEventAction and AContractAction, to define and execute actions that users must complete to be eligible for incentives.

There is a potential vulnerability related to the possibility of replaying actions within the Boost protocol. Currently, there is no mechanism to prevent a user from re-submitting the same action data multiple times to claim an incentive repeatedly. This issue arises because the current implementation does not track previously executed actions or associate them with a unique identifier.

## Code Snippets
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/actions/AAction.sol#L25

```solidity
/// @title Boost AAction

/// @notice Abstract contract for a generic AAction within the Boost protocol
/// ...
/// @notice Execute the action
/// @param data_ The data payload for the action
/// @return (success, data) A tuple of the success status and the returned data
function execute(bytes calldata data_) external payable virtual returns (bool, bytes memory);

/// @notice Prepare the action for execution and return the expected payload
/// ...
```

The execute function does not include any mechanism to prevent replays based on previous calls.

## Impact

This vulnerability could allow users to fraudulently claim incentives multiple times by simply resubmitting the same action data. This could lead to:

Depletion of Incentive Funds: Attackers could drain the funds allocated for incentives.
Inaccurate Boost Metrics: The number of legitimate participants and claims would be misrepresented.

## Scenario

Action Replay: A user successfully executes an action, for example, minting an NFT defined by the Boost.
Claim Incentive: The user submits the action data to claim the incentive associated with the Boost.

Replay and Reclaim: The user resubmits the same action data, triggering the claimIncentive function in the BoostCore contract again. Without replay protection, the claim would succeed again.

## Fix

To mitigate this vulnerability, the protocol needs to implement a mechanism to track completed actions and prevent replays. Here are two potential approaches:

Action Nonce: Introduce a nonce to the AAction contract. This nonce, incremented with each action execution, can be included in the data signed by the validator or incorporated into the claim process to ensure uniqueness.

Claim Tracking within Actions: Modify the AAction contract (or specific action implementations like EventAction or ContractAction) to include logic for tracking claims related to each action instance.
