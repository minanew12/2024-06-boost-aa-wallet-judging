# Incorrect function visibility in claimIncentiveFor

### Summary

```BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor``` is public so anyone can call ```claimIncentiveFor``` on behalf of another user. 

### Root Cause

In none of the tests, ```BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor``` is called, so it is likely that ```BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor``` is intended to be called through the external ```BoostCore::claimIncentive``` function, to ensure that claimant is always msg.sender. 

Yet, because ```BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor``` is public anyone can call ```BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor``` on behalf of another user, forcing that user to have to claim their incentive earlier than desired, limiting a users control over their incentives. 

The issue is that the function visibility here is public when it likely should be internal: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L170C1
