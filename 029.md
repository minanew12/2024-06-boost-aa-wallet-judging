# ERC20 Token with rebase/FOT feature

## Summary
There are certain ERC20 tokens, with additional features which might result in breaking the internal accounting of the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
Boost is intended to support any kinds of ERC20 token, but has not extended the support in terms of code.
Certain tokens like stETH/aAAVE has special features in their code such as rebalancing / FOT , like stETH has a 1 wei corner case .
If during transferring the token goes through rebalancing or has a fee in it then the internal accounting can be broken or user might recieve less amount than intended
#### ManagedBudget.sol
1> allocate()
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L70
for FOT type token the next lines will always revert
```solidity
 if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
                revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
            }
```
#### CGDA.Incentive.sol
While transferring tokens from the protocol to the recipient, if a rebasing occurs , the trust assumptions between users and project might be broken due to users receiving less amount due to deflation token

Since, if the balance changed later, the returned value will be inaccurate. And the amount used before and after that specific operation might differ.

## Impact
The ultimate effect will be seen during a point will be reached where the Token balance in the contract will be zero, while the internal accounting still registers that there are still amount available for users to collect

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
check the before and after balance of token for particular operation by calling IERC20(token).balanceOf() to confirm the balance or use the relative shares of each user instead of specific amount if necessary,
