# `CreateBoostAuth` address is not being tracked properly which is being used to create a Boost.

## Summary
When the address get authenticated for Creating Boost which is being done by the owner of the Boost Protocol. The address have to get authenticated again and again .

## Vulnerability Detail
So when the address is authenticated for creating the Boost by the owner of the Boost Protocol calling the function `setCreateBoostAuth` It grants the address the approval for creating the boost.
- But Suppose if there is multiple user at same time when User 1 gets approved and he waits sometime before creating the Boost but in the same span the User 2 also gets approved .
- Now User 1 will not be able to create Boost and he has to ask for the role again from the owner.
- Because the function is using the instance for storing the address and instance will have only one address at a time.
- So when User 2 gets approved he only can createBoost and after that if User 3 gets approval then User 2 have to again apply for the role to create another Boost.
- This will lead to call the function multiple time which results in more gas cosumption and this way protocol will loose out more money because of not tracking the addresses.

## Impact
Multiple time function calling will lead to loss of funds for the protocol.

## Recommendation
Try adding the mapping for the address which is being already authorised.
