# Due to wrong implementation of supportsInterface() boost creation will revert

## Summary
Interface id of AAction contract is checked incorrect way in AEventAction contract, for that reason the boost creation will revert if EventAction contract is used as base implementation for action.
## Vulnerability Detail
In AEventAction contract the `supportsInterface()` is used  by overridden, it overrides the AAction's supportsInterface(), & the AAction's supportsInterface() overrides the ACloneable's supportsInterface(). So while creating a boost when the BoostCore contract will check whether the ACloneable(instance) uses/supports that interfaceId by this line `!ACloneable(instance).supportsInterface(interfaceId)` the supportsInterface() will execute on AEventAction contract, as in that contract the function does check if the interfaceId is equal to `type(AAction).interfaceId` the execution will revert.
Here is a demo example how it is currently working & how it will revert, test this in remix:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

abstract contract A {
     function assertIt() public virtual {
        assert(1 == 1);
     }
}

abstract contract B is A {
    function assertIt() public virtual override(A){
        assert(1 == 1);
    }
}

abstract contract C is B {
    function assertIt() public virtual override(B){
       require(1 == 2, "I will not execute!");
    }
}

contract Normal is C {
    function doNothing() public {

    }
}

contract Test {
    Normal n;
    function execute(address _addr) public {
        n = Normal(_addr);
        A(address(n)).assertIt();
    }
}
```
Call the `execute()`.
## Impact
Boose creation will fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override(AAction) returns (bool) {
-    return interfaceId == type(AEventAction).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
+    return interfaceId == type(AEventAction).interfaceId || interfaceId == type(AAction).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
```
