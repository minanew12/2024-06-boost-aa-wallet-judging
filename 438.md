# Potential Griefing Vulnerability in ERC20Incentive Contract

## Details

The ERC20Incentive contract within the Boost protocol distributes ERC20 tokens as incentives using different strategies like POOL and RAFFLE. However, the RAFFLE strategy lacks sufficient protection against griefing attacks, where malicious actors could manipulate the entry list to reduce the chances of legitimate participants winning.

In the RAFFLE strategy, users claim a slot in the raffle by calling the claim function, which adds their address to the entries array. The winner is then selected randomly from this array using block.prevrandao and block.timestamp for randomness.

The vulnerability arises because the contract does not prevent duplicate entries. A malicious actor could call the claim function multiple times with the same address, adding their address to the entries array multiple times. This action would significantly increase their chances of being selected as the winner.

## Impact

This could lead to:

Unfair Advantage: Attackers could unfairly increase their chances of winning the raffle, disadvantaging legitimate participants.

Loss of Trust: The manipulation of the raffle outcome could erode trust in the platform and discourage future participation.

## Scenario

An attacker repeatedly calls the claim function with their address, adding their address to the entries array multiple times. When the drawRaffle function is called, the attacker has a disproportionately higher chance of being selected as the winner due to their multiple entries in the raffle.

## Fix

To mitigate this, implement a mechanism to prevent duplicate entries in the entries array. One approach is to track claimed addresses in a mapping within the claim function. Before adding an address to the entries array, check if the address has already been claimed.

Example:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/ERC20Incentive.sol#L76

```solidity
// Add this mapping inside the ERC20Incentive contract:
mapping(address => bool) public hasEnteredRaffle;

// Modify the claim function:
function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    // ... existing code

    } else {
        claims++;

        // Require that an address can only claim once
        if (hasEnteredRaffle[claimTarget]) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(msg.sender, "Address already entered raffle");
        }
        hasEnteredRaffle[claimTarget] = true;

        entries.push(claimTarget);
        emit Entry(claimTarget);
        return true;
    }
}
```

This modification ensures that each address can only be added to the entries array once, preventing the manipulation of raffle odds through duplicate entries.
