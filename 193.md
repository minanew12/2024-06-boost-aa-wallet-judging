# Centralization Risks

## Summary
The contract ``ManagedBudget`` relies heavily on the ``onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE)``. If compromised, this role could lead to significant losses.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the contract  ``ManagedBudget`` the role  ``onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE)`` has authority over the functions:
- claimBack()
- disburse()
- setAuthorized()
- grantRoles()
- revokeRoles()

## Impact
Any compromise to the ``onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE)`` account may allow the hacker to take advantage of this authority and
- reclaim assets from the budget
- disburse assets from the budget
- grant manager role
- set roles for accounts authorized to use the budget
- revoke roles for accounts authorized to use the budget

## Proof of Concept
**This test suite focuses primarily on how the admin account itself could be compromised**

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('hardhat');
const { expect } = require('chai');

describe('ManagedBudget Admin Hacking Test Suite', function () {
  let owner, admin, attacker;
  let managedBudget;

  beforeEach(async function () {
    [owner, admin, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Deploy a new ManagedBudget contract
    const ManagedBudget = await ethers.getContractFactory('ManagedBudget');
    managedBudget = await ManagedBudget.deploy();
    await managedBudget.initialize(
      ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(['address[]', 'uint256[]'], [[owner.address], []])
    );

    // Grant ADMIN_ROLE to admin
    await managedBudget.grantRoles([admin.address], [ADMIN_ROLE]);
  });

  it('Admin private key compromise', async function () {
    // Simulate admin's private key being compromised
    const compromisedAdmin = await ethers.getImpersonatedSigner(admin.address);

    // Compromised admin can still perform admin actions
    await managedBudget.connect(compromisedAdmin).grantRoles([attacker.address], [ADMIN_ROLE]);
    expect(await managedBudget.hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, attacker.address)).to.be.true;
  });

  it('Admin wallet phishing', async function () {
    // Simulate admin falling victim to a phishing attack
    const phishedAdmin = await ethers.getImpersonatedSigner(admin.address);

    // Phished admin can still perform admin actions
    await managedBudget.connect(phishedAdmin).revokeRoles([owner.address], [ADMIN_ROLE]);
    expect(await managedBudget.hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, owner.address)).to.be.false;
  });

  it('Admin wallet compromise through smart contract interaction', async function () {
    // Deploy a malicious contract that can drain admin's wallet
    const MaliciousContract = await ethers.getContractFactory('MaliciousContract');
    const maliciousContract = await MaliciousContract.deploy();

    // Simulate admin interacting with malicious contract
    await admin.sendTransaction({
      to: maliciousContract.address,
      value: ethers.utils.parseEther('1.0')
    });

    // Malicious contract can now drain admin's wallet
    await maliciousContract.drain(admin.address);

    // Check if admin's balance has been reduced
    const initialBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(admin.address);
    await maliciousContract.drain(admin.address);
    const finalBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(admin.address);
    expect(finalBalance).to.be.lt(initialBalance);
  });
});
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Strongly advise to carefully manage the privileged account's private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked.
In general, I vehemently recommend centralized privileges or roles in the protocol to be improved via a decentralized mechanism or smart-contract based accounts with enhanced security practices, eg., multisignature wallets. Indicatively, here are some feasible suggestions that can mitigate the potential risk at a different level:

1. Timelock and Multi sign combination mitigate the sensitive operation and avoiding a single point of key management failure.
- Time-lock with reasonable latency, eg., 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations;
AND
-  Assignment of privileged roles to mukti-signature wallets to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key compromised;
AND
- A medium/blog link for sharing the timelock contract and multi-signers addresses information with the public audience.

2. Timelock and DAO, the combination, mitigate by applying decentralization and transparency.
- Time-lock with reasonable latency, eg., 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations;
AND
- Introduction of a DAO/governance/voting module to increase transparency and user involvement.
AND
-  A medium/blog link for sharing the timelock contract and multi-signers addresses, and the DAO information with the public audience.
