# A User Completing An Action Again Will Not Be Eligible For The Incentive

## Summary

When a user completes an action he is eligible for an incentive claim , once the incentive is claimed the claims[] mapping is set to true in the Incentive contracts , but if the user completes the action again then he wont be able to claim his incentive again and his action performed will become worthless , a loss in minting an NFT for example (if the action was minting an NFT).

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) A user completes an action , say he has minted an NFT and now eligible for a claim , he calls `claimIncentive` ->

2.) The Incentive gets claimed , lets assume the incentive was a ERC20Incentive , when claimed our `claimed[]` mapping would be set to true ->

3.) The user after claiming the incentive performs the action again , the action was validated off-chain and now he gets another claim to be claimed since he completed the action , he calls `claimIncentive` again , which would call claim in the ERC20Incentive , 
but this time the call would revert ->

because the mapping claimed[] has been set to true , the user can't redeem his valid claim even though he has completed the action successfully , his action of minting an NFT cant be claimed.


## Impact

Even after completing the action the user would not be able to claim his incentive. If the action included some token transfers he would loose his token value and not even get an incentive.

## Recommendation

The claimed[] can be removed , but then make sure sigs are not malleable.
