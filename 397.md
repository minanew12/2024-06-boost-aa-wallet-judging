# Vulnerability in Incentive Claiming Logic

## Details

The Boost protocol leverages the claimed mapping within the AIncentive contract and its descendants to prevent users from claiming incentives multiple times. This mapping associates user addresses with a boolean value indicating whether they have already claimed a specific incentive.

A potential vulnerability exists in the way the claimed mapping is employed. Currently, this mapping only tracks if a user has claimed a specific type of incentive, not whether they have already claimed from a specific instance of an incentive. This could enable a malicious Boost creator to deploy multiple identical incentive contracts and use them within a single Boost, allowing users to claim the same incentive type multiple times.

## Code Snippets
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/AIncentive.sol#L32

```solidity
// AIncentive.sol
/// @notice The number of claims that have been made
uint256 public claims;

/// @notice The reward amount issued for each claim
uint256 public reward;

/// @notice A mapping of address to claim status
mapping(address => bool) public claimed;
```

## Impact

This vulnerability could allow attackers to artificially inflate the number of legitimate claims for a Boost. Users could be tricked into repeatedly claiming what they believe are unique incentives, leading to a misrepresentation of participation and potentially impacting the effectiveness of the Boost.

## Scenario

Malicious Boost Creation: An attacker deploys multiple identical instances of an ERC20Incentive contract, each offering the same reward. They then create a Boost using the BoostCore.createBoost function, including all of these identical incentive contracts within the Boost.

Multiple Incentive Claims: Unaware of the identical incentives, a user claims from one of the ERC20Incentive contracts. They then proceed to claim from another seemingly different but actually identical incentive contract within the same Boost, successfully claiming the same reward multiple times.

## Fix

To remediate this, the claimed mapping should be modified to track claims against a specific instance of an incentive contract rather than just the incentive type.

Option 1: Include the incentive contract address in the claimed mapping:

```solidity
// AIncentive.sol
mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public claimed; // incentiveContract => claimant => claimed

// In the claim function:
claimed[address(this)][claimant] = true;
```
Option 2: Utilize a unique identifier for each incentive instance within the claim function, potentially generated during incentive deployment or by hashing relevant parameters.
