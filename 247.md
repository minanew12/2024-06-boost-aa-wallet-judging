# Users can't get incentives in certain cases even when the action is completed successfully

## Summary
The ``isClaimable`` compares the claimable value with ``limit`` state variable. But there resides a possibility where a user will not be able to claim their incentives even when they have completed the action successfully due to limit imposed which is unfair. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Take a look at ``claimIncentiveFor``
```Solidity
    function claimIncentiveFor( 
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_, 
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, function is nonReentrant)
        if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```
As you can see, there's a call that goes on boost.incentives and invoke claim function. Suppose in this case, we have ``ERC20Incentive.sol`` as the incentive contract. Here when the claim is invoked, the function first checks through ``_isClaimable`` if with certain checks out of which, one of the check is ``claims < limit`` . limit here is configured during initialization of the contract.

This might be problematic in a scenario where a user has completed an action but can't claim their incentives due to surpassed limit. 

1. Limit == 50
2. Suppose Alice should be number 49
3. Alice completes an Action and calls for claim, but meanwhile 2 more users claimed before Alice and the limit is surpassed. 
4. Now Alice will not get any claim even though that task is completed. 

## Impact
Users might not be able to claim their rewards even after subsequent completion of the Action which is loss for the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
While action is being performed, we have to first check if limit is surpassed or not and if that's true the action should not be performed.
