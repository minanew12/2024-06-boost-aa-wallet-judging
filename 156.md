# BoostCore.sol: _makeIncentives trying to disburse the budget will always revert

### Summary

The function [BoostCore.sol::_makeIncentives](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L266-L291) will deploy the new incentive proxies [1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L273-L278) and after constructing the preflight data [2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L280-L282) i will try to disperse the budget needed [3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L283-L286). This call will always fail as the BoostCore contract should never be approved as a manager/admin/owner of the `ManagedBudget` contract.

### Root Cause

The BoostCore.sol contract does check the budged access rights when creating a new Boost by calling [BoostCore.sol::_checkBudget](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L232-L235). This correctly verifies that the msg.sender is authorized to call disburse on the budget.
But when creating the incentives and calling [budget_.disburse(preflight)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L285), the msg.sender for that call is no longer the user that is authorized, but the BoostCore.sol contract. Thus the modifier [onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE | MANAGER_ROLE)
](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L131) of the `ManagedBudget.sol::disburse` function will revert the call.

### Attack Path

### Impact

As none of the incentives can get funded, the protocol can not function in any form.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

As the initializer of the incentive contracts expects the funds to be already transferred and as it is necessary to call the `initialize` function in the same tx, fixing this issue needs big design designs.
It would be possible to change the initialize functions and transfer the tokens at a later stage - by the creator calling the budged directly. Alternatively, the budged could be updated to take EIP712 signatures to approve transfers.
