# protocol fee will be lost.

## Summary
we are not checking whether the protocolFeeReceiver is address(0).This will cause the protocol fee to be lost.
## Vulnerability Detail
Here we can see that we are not checking the zero address check in the function setProtocolFeeReceiver.
function setProtocolFeeReceiver(address protocolFeeReceiver_) external  onlyOwner {
   @>>     protocolFeeReceiver = protocolFeeReceiver_;
    }

In this function _routeClaimFee we are sending the ETH to the protocolFeeReceiver without checking the address ,this may cause the ETH to be lost.
  function _routeClaimFee(BoostLib.Boost storage boost, address referrer_) internal {
        if (claimFee == 0) return;
        uint256 netFee = claimFee;

        // If a referrer is provided, transfer the revshare and reduce the net fee
        if (referrer_ != address(0)) {
            uint256 referralShare = claimFee * boost.referralFee / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
            netFee -= referralShare;
            referrer_.safeTransferETH(referralShare);
        }

        // The remaining fee is split between the owner and the protocol
        boost.owner.safeTransferETH(netFee / 2);
      @>>  protocolFeeReceiver.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
## Impact
protocol fee will be lost.

## Recommendation
function setProtocolFeeReceiver(address protocolFeeReceiver_) external onlyOwner {
   ++if(protocolFee!=0 && protocolFeeReceiver_==address(0))
   ++        revert;

        protocolFeeReceiver = protocolFeeReceiver_;
    }
