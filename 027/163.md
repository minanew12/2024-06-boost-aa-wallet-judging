# revokeRoles function lacks event emission

## Summary
The `ManagedBudget::revokeRoles` function lacks event emissions, making it difficult to track off-chain

## Vulnerability Detail
``ManagedBudget::revokeRoles`` function modifies role assignments without emitting an event.

## Impact
Reduced transparency as off-chain systems relying on event logs cannot accurately track role assignments. It becomes challenging to reconstruct the history of role assignments and revocations, and without event logs, it becomes harder to trace unauthorized role assignments or malicious activities.
