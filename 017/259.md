# Cross-chain replay attack due to missing chainId in signature validation

## Summary

The `SignerValidator` contract within the Boost Protocol is vulnerable to a potential replay attack when Boost campaigns are deployed on multiple chains. The absence of chain-specific data (e.g., `chainId`) in the signature hashing process allows a malicious user to reuse a valid signature from one chain to claim rewards on other chains without performing the required action on these chains, resulting in unauthorized incentives being claimed.

## Vulnerability Detail

This vulnerability arises from the absence of `chainId` in the `hashSignerData` function, which is responsible for generating the signature used to validate claims. When claiming an incentive, the contract generates a hash of the `boostId`, `incentiveQuantity`, claimant's address, and incentive data. However, this hash does not include the `chainId`, which makes the signature valid across multiple chains.

An attacker can exploit this by completing the required action on the cheapest chain (for example, a low-cost chain like Binance Smart Chain or Polygon) and obtaining a valid signature. With this signature, the attacker can then submit the same signature on other chains (such as Ethereum) to claim rewards without performing the required action on those chains.

### Exploitation Example

1. A project owner deploys Boosts on multiple chains (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon) to encourage user engagement across different networks.
2. A malicious actor identifies that the same Boost is deployed on all chains, but notices the absence of `chainId` in the signature hashing process.
3. The attacker completes the required action (such as interacting with the project or staking tokens) on the cheapest chain (e.g., Polygon), obtaining a valid signature.
4. The attacker uses this valid signature to claim the rewards on other chains (e.g., Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain) without completing the required action on those chains.
5. The attacker effectively steals rewards by bypassing the intended mechanism, where the project owner expected users to interact with the project on each chain to claim rewards.

## Impact

A malicious actor can exploit the absence of `chainId` to claim rewards across multiple chains after completing the required action on only one chain. This compromises the Boost reward system and results in theft from the Boost creator, who expects engagement across all chains but is instead defrauded.

## Tool used

VSCode

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to include the `chainId` in the signature hash. By doing so, signatures will be unique to each chain, preventing them from being reused across different networks.

### Recommended Fix

Modify the `hashSignerData` function to include the `chainId` as part of the signature hash:

```diff
function hashSignerData(uint256 boostId, uint8 incentiveQuantity, address claimant, bytes memory incentiveData)
    public
    view
    returns (bytes32 hashedSignerData)
{
    return _hashTypedData(
        keccak256(
-           abi.encode(_SIGNER_VALIDATOR_TYPEHASH, boostId, incentiveQuantity, claimant, keccak256(incentiveData))
+           abi.encode(_SIGNER_VALIDATOR_TYPEHASH, block.chainid, boostId, incentiveQuantity, claimant, keccak256(incentiveData))
        )
    );
}
```
