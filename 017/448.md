# Signature replay attack, due to missing chainID value in EIP712 TYPEHASH

### Summary

Boost project will be deployed to many blockchains. But signature dont include chainId value, so signature could be replaied on different chains.

### Root Cause

In `SignerValidator.sol:28` typehash dont include chain id value. So, the same signature could be valid in the differenet blockchains

### Internal pre-conditions

Boost validator should be SignerValidator.sol

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Boost creator create boost on different blockchains and using validator SignerValidator.sol
2. User execute action on ethereum (for example) chain and receive signature
3. User receive reward on all blockchains, using only one signature, where creator created this boost.

### Impact

User execute only once action on one blockchain, and could dont execute actions on others blockchains and use signature, which he received for the first action and claim reward

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include in typehash chainId value. Also change function hashSignerData(), which should include chainid in hash
