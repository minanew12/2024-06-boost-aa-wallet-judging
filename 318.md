# Weird tokens will impact protocol functionality for users

### Summary

The use of non-standard tokens (e.g. rebasing and fee-on-transfer) will cause unexpected behavior and potential fund loss for users, boost creators as these tokens will interfere with balance checks, reward distributions, and budget allocations.


### Root Cause

On the contest page, the assumption is to work with all weird tokens:

> Protocol should work with all native and ERC20 tokens that adhear to standard including weird tokens. No assumptions are made in regards to the properties of integrating tokens and weird trait tokens should be handled normally. Specifically we'd expect to interact with USDT and other stable coins/decimal 6 coins and erc20z from Zora as well as other fractional NFT contracts as long as they adhere to ERC20 standard. We aren't whitelisting tokens so any erc20 should work (including weird ones).

However, throughout the protocol there are several issues when using weird tokens like rebase or fee-on-transfer
Some illustrations:

Incentive Contracts:
In the ERC20Incentive contract, the claim transfers preconfigured reward amount

Also the initialization process checks the contract's balance:
```solidity
uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
if (available < maxTotalReward) {
    revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, maxTotalReward);
}
```
For rebasing tokens, if a negative rebase occurs after initialization, the contract may not have enough tokens to pay out all rewards. For fee-on-transfer tokens, the actual received amount might be less than expected, causing initialization to fail.
The clawback would also be able to only recover partial amount as it checks for amount to be withdrawn to be multiple of a fixed reward, resulting in **permanent loss of funds**. There is a fairness issue as well, as later claimants will receive less or more value for their rebased token.


ManagedBudget Contract:
In the allocate function, there's a check that might fail for fee-on-transfer tokens:
```solidity

if (request.asset.balanceOf(address(this)) < payload.amount) {
    revert InvalidAllocation(request.asset, payload.amount);
}
```
The actual received amount would be less than payload.amount, causing this check to fail, causing issues with initial allocation.

Boost Interactions:
The ManagedBudget contract doesn't track individual allocations for each Boost. If a rebasing event occurs between the creation of two Boosts, the second Boost might have access to more or fewer tokens than intended, potentially affecting the fairness and consistency of the protocol.
These issues could lead to unexpected reverts, inconsistent protocol state, and potential loss of funds for users.

### Attack Path

Sample attack path other paths are mentioned in root cause.
1. Boost creater initialixes an ERC20Incentive with a rebasing token
2. Rebasing event occurs, reducing the balance of the incentive contract
3. Users attempt to claim rewards, but there are insufficient funds
4. Creator also cannot clawback as the amount does not match configured rewards

### Impact

These issues could lead to unexpected reverts, inconsistent protocol state, and potential loss of funds for users.
