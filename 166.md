# "Critical Transaction Failure Vulnerability in ManagedBudget.sol: Incomplete Balance Validation in available() and disburse() Functions"

### Summary

The issue arises due to inadequate balance validation in the `ManagedBudget.sol `contract. Transactions fail when `payload.amount == avail` as the contract only checks for zero address amounts in the `available()` function and uses a greater-than comparison in the `disburse()` function. This leads to transaction errors for users when the requested amount equals the available balance.

### Root Cause

The function `available()` of `ManagedBudget.sol:256` [Here](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/boost-protocol/blob/315e6a83d1ba137d95d5904e8f5fd1b513d5c505/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L256) only checks for zero addresses and does not account for when `payload.amount == avail`. In ManagedBudget.sol:139, [Here](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/boost-protocol/blob/315e6a83d1ba137d95d5904e8f5fd1b513d5c505/packages/evm/contracts/budgets/ManagedBudget.sol#L139) logic checks if `payload.amount > avail`, but misses the case where `payload.amount` equals `avail`.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users experience failed transactions when `payload.amount` == `avail` due to insufficient checks in the `available()` function, which only validates zero address amounts and uses a greater-than comparison in `disburse()` function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the check in the `disburse()` function to include =, ensuring transactions succeed when `payload.amount == avail`. Recommended change:

` if (payload.amount >= avail) {
                revert InsufficientFunds(request.asset, avail, payload.amount);
  }`
