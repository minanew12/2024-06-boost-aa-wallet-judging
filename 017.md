# Missing an authentication step in `ManagedBudget#disburse` will cause cross-budget losses as an attacker will use funds from other honest budgets for their own malicious incentive

### Summary

Missing an authentication step in `ManagedBudget#disburse` will cause cross-budget losses as an attacker will use funds from other honest budgets for their own malicious incentive.

### Root Cause

In the `ManagedBudget#disburse` function, there is a modifier `onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE | MANAGER_ROLE)`

Because of that, the `BoostCore` contract has to be granted a `ADMIN_ROLE` or `MANAGER_ROLE`, in order to transfer funds from a budget to the incentive contracts

Since the `BoostCore` contract will have `ADMIN_ROLE` or `MANAGER_ROLE` in every `ManagedBudget` contract, an attacker can use other budgets for their own incentive contracts.

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates a budget and allocates `100 USDC` to it
2. An attacker creates:
   - An incentive contract
   - A malicious validator that allows only the attacker to claim from the incentive contract
   - A boost that uses Alice's budget, the above incentive contract and validator
3. `100 USDC` from Alice's budget is transferred to the attacker's incentive contract
4. The attacker claims `100 USDC` from the incentive contract

### Impact

The attacker stoles funds from cross-budgets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. The `ManagedBudget#disburse` function should take two parameters: `bytes calldata data_`, `address caller`. In the function, `caller` is validated against the contract owner.
2. The `BoostCore` contract should pass `msg.sender` as `caller`

-               assert(budget_.disburse(preflight));
+               assert(budget_.disburse(preflight, msg.sender));
            }
