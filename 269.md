# Incomplete EIP-712 Implementation: DOMAIN_SEPARATOR Missing

## Summary
The contract implements parts of EIP-712 for structured data hashing and signing but lacks a crucial component: the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR. This missing element is vital for preventing cross-contract replay attacks and ensuring compliance with the EIP-712 standard.

## Vulnerability Detail
EIP-712 requires a DOMAIN_SEPARATOR to uniquely identify the contract and prevent replay attacks. This separator includes contract-specific information such as the contract's name, version, chain ID, and contract address. In the current implementation:

1. The DOMAIN_SEPARATOR is not calculated or stored.
2. The _hashTypedData function does not use a DOMAIN_SEPARATOR for hashing.
Without a properly implemented DOMAIN_SEPARATOR, there is a risk that signed data could be replayed across different contracts or chains, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

## Impact
The contract partially complies with the EIP-712 standard, potentially causing interoperability issues or complications with external integrations that rely on EIP-712 for data signing and verification.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR calculation in the constructor using contract-specific information. Store it as an immutable value.
Update _hashTypedData Function:

Ensure the _hashTypedData function incorporates the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR in its hashing process. This will ensure that the signed data is unique to the contract and chain, preventing replay attacks.
