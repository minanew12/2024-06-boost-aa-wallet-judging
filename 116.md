# Boost Creation Vulnerability Leading to Denial-of-Service (DOS) Attack

### Summary

When a user wants to create a Boost, the `BoostCore` clone several additional contracts, one of which is the Incentives contract. The Incentives contract needs to be clone first but is not initialize. Only the BoostCore contract should initialize the Incentive.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is that the initializer function of the Incentives contract is public. This means that between the time the contract is deployed and the time the `BoostCore` calls the `initializer`, a malicious actor could call the `initializer` themselves and take ownership of the contract, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) or other exploits.

```solidity
    function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
        InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));

        if (init_.reward == 0 || init_.limit == 0) revert BoostError.InvalidInitialization();

        // Ensure the maximum reward amount has been allocated
        uint256 maxTotalReward = init_.strategy != Strategy.RAFFLE ? init_.reward * init_.limit : init_.reward;
        uint256 available = init_.asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (available < maxTotalReward) {
            revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(init_.asset, available, maxTotalReward);
        }

        asset = init_.asset;
        strategy = init_.strategy;
        reward = init_.reward;
        limit = init_.limit;
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    }
```


### Attack Path

1. A user wants to create a boost, so he constructs the necessary parameters to create the Boost in the `BoostCore`.
2. The `BoostCore` deploy the incentive clone but it's not initialize yet
3. An attacker can intervene during this window and call the `initializer`.
4. The `BoostCore` sends funds to the Incentives contract and calls the `initializer`.
5. Since the Incentives contract has already been initialized by the attacker, this leads to a revert when `BoostCore` attempts to initialize it, effectively blocking the creation of the boost.

### Impact

This vulnerability could prevent legitimate users from creating or interacting with Boosts, disrupting the service and impacting overall protocol functionality.


### Mitigation

To prevent this issue, the initialize function must be restricted to be callable only by the `BoostCore` contract to ensures that no malicious actor can initialize the Incentives contracts and claim ownership before the `BoostCore`.

Additionally, it's recommended that all other contracts that have an `initializer` function should also restrict access to only authorized entities. (action, allowList, validator)
