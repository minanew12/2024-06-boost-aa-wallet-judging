# Incorrect Use of abi.decode for Complex Struct in `EventAction.sol::Initialize Function`

## Summary

The initialize function in the contract attempts to decode a complex struct (InitPayload) directly using abi.decode, which is not the correct approach for handling nested structs in Solidity.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-walletfethallaheth/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/actions/EventAction.sol#L32C1-L34C6

The current implementation:

```solidity
function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public virtual override initializer {
    _initialize(abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload)));
}
```

This approach assumes that abi.decode can directly decode into the InitPayload struct, which contains nested structs (ActionClaimant and multiple ActionStep). However, abi.decode doesn't handle nested structs this way.

## Impact

his incorrect usage can lead to:

1. Potential contract deployment failures
2. Incorrect initialization of contract state if the decoding doesn't revert but produces unexpected results

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the initialize function to decode the components of InitPayload separately:

```solidity
function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public virtual override initializer {
    (
        ActionClaimant memory actionClaimant,
        ActionStep memory actionStepOne,
        ActionStep memory actionStepTwo,
        ActionStep memory actionStepThree,
        ActionStep memory actionStepFour
    ) = abi.decode(data_, (ActionClaimant, ActionStep, ActionStep, ActionStep, ActionStep));
   
    _initialize(InitPayload(actionClaimant, actionStepOne, actionStepTwo, actionStepThree, actionStepFour));
}

```
