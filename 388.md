# `ManagedBudget` and `AManagedBudget` Contract Does Not Fully Implement ERC1155 Interface

## Summary

duplicate of https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles-judging/issues/287

## Vulnerability Detail

The `AManagedBudget` contract is intended to support multiple interfaces, including `ERC1155`. However, the current implementation of the `supportsInterface` function does not correctly return true for the `ERC1155` interface ID (0xd9b67a26). This non-compliance can lead to interoperability issues with other contracts and tools that expect the contract to adhere to the `ERC1155` standard.

The `supportsInterface` function currently checks for the interface IDs of AManagedBudget, IERC1155Receiver, and IERC165, as well as any interfaces supported by ABudget. However, it does not explicitly check for the ERC1155 interface ID (0xd9b67a26).

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override(ABudget, IERC165) returns (bool) {
        return interfaceId == type(AManagedBudget).interfaceId || interfaceId == type(IERC1155Receiver).interfaceId
            || interfaceId == type(IERC165).interfaceId || ABudget.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
```
## Impact

 The contract is to be a strict implementation of ERC1155, but it does not implement the mandatory ERC1155.supportsInterface() function.
