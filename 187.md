# Missing zero address checks

### Summary


The bug report highlights a medium severity issue in the `_makeAllowListPayload()` function. The vulnerability arises from missing zero address validation for the `target_` parameter. If `target_` is incorrectly set to a zero address (0x0), the contract could allow an invalid address onto the allow list. Since the function directly assigns `target_` to the users array, this could lead to unintended behavior. 

### Root Cause

In AllowListIncentive.sol:74 [Here](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/boost-protocol/blob/315e6a83d1ba137d95d5904e8f5fd1b513d5c505/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/AllowListIncentive.sol#L74)  there is no implementation of zero address validation in the `_makeAllowListPayload()` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. No zero address validation exists in _`makeAllowListPayload`.

2. The contract allows `claimTarget` to be any address without checks.

### External pre-conditions

An attacker is able to submit a `claimTarget` with a zero address.

### Attack Path
An attacker is able to submit a `claimTarget` with a zero address.

### Impact

 The missing zero address validation could allow an invalid (0x0) address to be added to the allow list, potentially leading to improper access control or unintended contract behavior.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this, it is recommended to add a check ensuring that `target_` is not the zero address before proceeding with the logic, preventing invalid addresses from being added.
