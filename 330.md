# Protocol can break for a token with a proxy and implementation contract (like `TUSD`)

## Summary
Some tokens (e.g. USDC, USDT) are upgradable, allowing the token owners to make arbitrary modifications to the logic of the token at any point in time.
A change to the token semantics can break any smart contract that depends on the past behaviour.

Tokens whose code and logic can be changed in future can break the protocol and lock user funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
For a token like `TUSD` (supported by Chainlink TUSD/USD price feed), which has a proxy and implementation contract, if the implementation behind the proxy is changed, it can introduce features which break the protocol, like choosing to not return a bool on transfer(), or changing the balance over time like a rebasing token.

## Impact
Protocol may break in future or block user funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
* Developers integrating with upgradable tokens should consider introducing logic that will freeze interactions with the token in question if an upgrade is detected. (e.g. the [TUSD adapter](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-deploy/blob/7394f6555daf5747686a1b29b2f46c6b2c64b061/src/join.sol#L322) used by MakerDAO).
* OR have a token whitelist which does not allow such tokens.
