# setValidateCaller Whenever Called , Will Lead To Claims Being DoSed

## Summary

Eventhough `setValidateCaller` is onlyOwner BUT it's execution would always lead to claims getting revert on the Boost Core , DoSing the claiming mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) When an incentive is claimed , the data is validated here -->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L176

and inside the validate function ->

```solidity
function validate(uint256 boostId, uint256 incentiveId, address claimant, bytes calldata claimData)
        external
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        if (msg.sender != _validatorCaller) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
```

therefore , since msg.sender is BoostCore then the _validatorCaller would be the BoostCore , all good till here.

2.) There's a function to change the `_validatorCaller` ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L89

Whenever the validatorCaller is updated  , then the BoostCore would not be the validatorCaller and hence all the claim calls from the BoostCore will revert due to the check

## Impact

Claims would be DoSed whenever the setValidateCaller is used.

## Recommendation

Make sure the validateCaller can only be the BoostCore
