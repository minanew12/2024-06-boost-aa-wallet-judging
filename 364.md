# CGDAIncentive: Users can claim more than the total budget of the CGDAIncentive

### Summary

In `CGDAIncentive's` claim function. Users can claim more than the `totalBudget` of the Incentive. There is no check that the `total claimed rewards` <= `totalBudget`.  All claims could total more than the `totalBudget` at the end of the day. 

Also, a single user can wipe the entire token balance of this contract in 1 transaction if they wait long enough and `reward` gets set to `available` inside the `currentRewards()` function.

[CGDAIncentive.sol#L123 : currentReward()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L123)

### Root Cause

The lack of a field to store the total rewards is wrong. A `cgdaParams.totalRewards` field would help to keep track of how much rewards have been paid out and used to compare to totalBudget so we don't give out more than totalBudget in claims.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Sum of all claims > totalBudget. Claims would continue until `asset.balanceOf(CGDAIncentive)` is exhausted

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Multiple users submit claims until `asset.balanceOf(CGDAIncentive)` is exhausted.
2. A single user waits long enough if lucky and no other user claims before them and submits a single claim to wipe all of the balance of CGDAIncentive.

### Impact

The boost loses more tokens than they have budgeted to give out in claims for this incentive.
