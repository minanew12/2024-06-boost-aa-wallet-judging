# Front-Running and DoS in register Function

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `register` function in the `BoostRegistry.sol` contract allows anyone to register a new base implementation with a given type and name. This function can be exploited by an attacker who monitors the mempool for transactions attempting to register a new base implementation. The attacker can then front-run the transaction by calling the `register` function with the same name, effectively preventing the original user from registering their implementation. resulting in a Denial of Service.

```solidity
/// @notice Register a new base implementation of a given type
/// @param type_ The base type for the implementation
/// @param name_ A name for the implementation (must be unique within the given type)
/// @param implementation_ The address of the implementation contract
/// @dev This function will either emit a `Registered` event or revert if the identifier has already been registered
/// @dev The given address must implement the given type interface (See {ERC165-supportsInterface})
function register(RegistryType type_, string calldata name_, address implementation_)
    external
    onlyACloneables(implementation_)
{//@audit-anyone can frontrunn anyone and make DOS by registering a dummy
    bytes32 identifier = getIdentifier(type_, name_);

    if (address(_bases[identifier]) != address(0)) revert AlreadyRegistered(type_, identifier);
    _bases[identifier] = ACloneable(implementation_);

    emit Registered(type_, identifier, implementation_);
}

```
### **Example Scenario**

1. **User A** wants to register a new base implementation with the name "MyImplementation" and submits a transaction to the `register` function.
2. **Attacker B** monitors the mempool and sees User A's transaction.
3. **Attacker B** quickly submits their own transaction to the `register` function with the same name "MyImplementation" but with a different implementation address.
4. **Attacker B's** transaction gets mined first, and the name "MyImplementation" is now registered with their implementation address.
5. **User A's** transaction fails with the `AlreadyRegistered` error, preventing them from registering their intended implementation.

This results in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack where legitimate users are unable to register their implementations due to front-running.
