# `safeTransferFrom()` function didn't check the codesize of the token address which may leads to loss of funds.

## Summary
While setting up the budget for the boost when the token is transferred to the Budget contract it will still return true if the token is not being transferred.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the boost is being setted up by the user or the protocol who is going to use Boost. While setting up the boost they will allocate funds for the budget they are going to use here.
If there is some malicious user who want to exploit will use any random address as a token address and because of using `solady library` function `safeTransferFrom()` which not checks the codesize ,we will not know about the existense of that contract.

Hence this will lead to miscalculation and maybe a loss of funds because when the `safeTransferFrom()`is called on that random address which didn't have any contract on it, it will always return success, bypassing the return value check. Due to this protocol will think that funds has been transferred successfully , and records will be accordingly updated, but in reality funds were never transferred.

So this will lead to miscalculation and possibly loss of funds.

## Impact
It will lead to miscalculation of contract balance which will result in a huge fund loss for the protocol.

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation
Implement a code existence check by checking the codesize of the address.
