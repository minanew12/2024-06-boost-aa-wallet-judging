# Insufficient Handling of Rebasing Tokens in the Boost Protocol

## Details

The Boost protocol, while designed for flexibility with various ERC20 tokens, encounters difficulties when handling rebasing tokens like Ampleforth. These tokens automatically adjust their supply in response to market conditions, impacting the balance held by addresses, including Boost protocol contracts.

Rebasing tokens introduce complexities due to their automatic supply adjustments. These adjustments can cause:

Inconsistent Incentive Amounts: The intended reward amount for a boost may not match the actual amount received by users if a rebase event occurs between the time the boost is created and when the reward is claimed.

Accounting Challenges: The Boost protocol's internal accounting, relying on a fixed token balance view, might become inaccurate when a rebasing token adjusts its supply.

Budget Discrepancies: Budgets allocated for incentives could be thrown off by the fluctuating supply of rebasing tokens.

## Code Snippets

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L123

```solidity
// CGDAIncentive.sol
// ...
function currentReward() public view override returns (uint256) {
    // ... (Calculates projectedReward)

    uint256 available = asset.balanceOf(address(this)); // Potential issue with rebasing tokens

    return projectedReward > available ? available : projectedReward;
}
// ...
```

In this function, asset.balanceOf(address(this)) retrieves the balance of the incentive token held by the contract. However, for rebasing tokens, this balance can change unpredictably due to rebase events. The calculated available amount might not reflect the true balance at the time of a subsequent claim, potentially leading to discrepancies.

## Impact

The dynamic nature of rebasing tokens introduces the following risks:

Unpredictable Rewards: Users claiming rewards in rebasing tokens might receive more or less than anticipated, depending on the timing of rebase events.

Budget Instability: The actual cost of incentives in rebasing tokens becomes uncertain, as the token's supply and, consequently, its value can fluctuate.

## Scenario

- A boost is initiated, offering rewards in Ampleforth (AMPL), a rebasing token.
- AMPL undergoes a rebase event. Depending on market conditions, this event could increase or decrease the total AMPL supply. If the supply decreases, balances generally decrease as well.
- A user, eligible for an AMPL reward, initiates a claim.
- Due to the rebase, the user might receive a different AMPL amount than originally intended. If a rebase caused their balance to decrease, they will receive a lower reward than anticipated.

## Fix
- Before and after any action (allocation, disbursement, claim) involving a rebasing token, record the user's token balance and the contract's internal accounting balance.

- Calculate the balance difference caused by the rebase event.

- Adjust the contract's internal accounting to reflect the new balance, ensuring consistency.
