# External Call Status Check in drawRaffle Function

## Summary
The `ERC20Incentive::drawRaffle` function does not check the status of the `safeTransfer` call. Although safeTransfer is designed to revert on failure, it is a best practice to explicitly check the return status to ensure that the transfer was successful. Failure to do so can lead to unnoticed failed transfers, causing inconsistencies in the contract state.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function does not verify the success of the `safeTransfer` call. This oversight can result in failed transfers going unnoticed, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.
## Impact
If the `safeTransfer` call fails and the failure is not explicitly checked, the contract may proceed as if the transfer was successful, which can cause discrepancies in the contract's state, leading to financial losses or incorrect data being stored.

## Proof of Concept
This test case demonstrates the vulnerability by mocking a failed transfer and showing that the Claimed event is still emitted.
```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Raffle Contract", function () {
    let Raffle, raffle, owner, addr1, addr2, asset;

    beforeEach(async function () {
        [owner, addr1, addr2, ...addrs] = await ethers.getSigners();
        const Asset = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockERC20");
        asset = await Asset.deploy("Mock Asset", "MA", 1000);
        await asset.deployed();

        Raffle = await ethers.getContractFactory("Raffle");
        raffle = await Raffle.deploy(asset.address, 100);
        await raffle.deployed();
    });

    it("Should emit Claimed event even if transfer fails", async function () {
        // Add entries
        await raffle.connect(owner).addEntry(addr1.address);
        await raffle.connect(owner).addEntry(addr2.address);

        // Set strategy to RAFFLE
        await raffle.connect(owner).setStrategy(1); // Assuming 1 is RAFFLE

        // Mock transfer to fail by not approving the raffle contract to transfer tokens
        await asset.connect(owner).approve(raffle.address, 0);

        // Draw raffle and expect the Claimed event to be emitted despite transfer failure
        await expect(raffle.connect(owner).drawRaffle())
            .to.emit(raffle, "Claimed")
            .withArgs(addr1.address, ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(["address", "address", "uint256"], [asset.address, addr1.address, 100]));
    });
});
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
**Explicitly check the return status of the `safeTransfer` call and handle any failures appropriately.**
