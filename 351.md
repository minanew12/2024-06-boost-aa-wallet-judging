# Incompatible Data Structures in Boost Protocol Prevent Reuse of Validator Signatures for Multiple Incentive Types (ERC20 & ERC1155)

## Summary
The vulnerability is in the inability of a single validator signature to be reused across different types of incentive claims. The protocol design intends for one signature to be valid across various incentive claims, including ERC20 and ERC1155 incentives. However, due to differences in how these incentives' data is structured and used in the signature creation, this behavior fails, which can lead to broken functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol allows Boost Creators to set up incentives that may involve distributing rewards in different formats, such as ERC20 tokens and ERC1155 tokens. In such cases, the design is supposed to allow a single validator signature to be used for claiming rewards from both ERC20 and ERC1155 incentives. However, the vulnerability emerges due to the differences in how the data for these two incentive types is structured and processed during the signature validation process.

Protocol setup two contracts `ERC20VariableIncentive.sol` and `ERC1155Incentive.sol` for the incentives. One signature from the validator should work for claiming both rewards but this will not happen. 

1. ERC20 Variable Incentive Data: The signature for claiming ERC20-based incentives includes data in the format (uint256 signedAmount). This means the signed data focuses on an amount associated with the ERC20 incentive.
> /// @param data_ The data payload for the incentive claim `(uint256signedAmount)`

2. ERC1155 Incentive Data: In contrast, for ERC1155-based incentives, the claim data is structured differently, as (address recipient, bytes data).
> /// @param data_ The data payload for the incentive claim `(address recipient, bytes data)`

```solidity
bytes32 hash = hashSignerData(boostId, validatorData.incentiveQuantity, claimant, claim.incentiveData);
```

The hashSignerData function creates the hash based on the claim.incentiveData that comes from either the ERC20 or ERC1155 incentive data. If the digest (hash) is generated for the ERC1155 incentive using (address recipient, bytes data) format, this same signature will not work when attempting to claim from the ERC20VariableIncentive since it expects the data to be formatted as (uint256 signedAmount).

So if the digest is generated considering `(address recipient, bytes data)` this then while claiming from the ERC20VariableIncentive::claim() it will decode differently and the amount will be completely different

The protocol's expectation of using a single signature for multiple incentive claims (ERC20 and ERC1155) is broken due to the incompatible data encoding used by different incentive types.


## Impact

Loss of funds as if the decoded signed amount in ERC20VariableIncentive is higher than expected then it will cause loss of incentives for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To resolve this issue, the protocol should unify or standardize the encoding of the incentiveData across all incentive types.
