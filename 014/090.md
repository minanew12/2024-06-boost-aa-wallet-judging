# Double intialization of owner in ERC20VariableIncentive could cause issues

## Vulnerability Detail
In `ERC20VariableIncentive`'s `initialize` function `_initializeOwner` is called twice. 
```solidity
function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
        // ...SNIP....
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    }
```
The issue can become significant in a future upgrade where the function `Ownable::_guardInitializeOwner` is overridden to prevent double initialization of owner.
```solidity
function _guardInitializeOwner() internal pure override returns (bool guard) {
   guard = true;
}
```

## Impact
Initialization of ERC20VariableIncentive always revert due to double owner initialization (in case `_guardInitializeOwner` is overridden in future upgrades)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For safety, just remove one of the `_initializeOwner(msg.sender);` in the `initialize` function
