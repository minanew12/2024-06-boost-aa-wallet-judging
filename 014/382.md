# Unnecessary second initialization call can potentially prevent `ERC20VariableIncentive` and `ERC1155Incentive` contract from successfully initializing..

### Summary

Both contracts use the `initialize` function to set the contract's incentive parameters and assign the deployer as the owner. However, the initialize function makes two calls to `_initializeOwner`. In the first call, the owner is initialized with `msg.sender`. When the function attempts the second call, it checks if the owner is already set. Since the owner is indeed set (i.e., `sload(_OWNER_SLOT)` returns a non-zero value), this call will revert with an `AlreadyInitialized()` error.

This revert prevents the proper functioning of the contract. If the contract reverts during initialization due to the second call to `_initializeOwner`, no valid owner will be assigned, which blocks access to crucial contract functionalities like `claim` and `clawback`. Consequently, the state of the contract remains such that ownership is not correctly assigned to the deployer, leading to significant operational and security risks.

### Code Snippet

```javascript
function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
@>       _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
        // initialization logic

@>        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
    }

```

### Root Cause

The issue arises from making multiple calls to `_initializeOwner` within the `initialize` function

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The issue prevents the contract from initializing properly, resulting in no valid owner being assigned. This ultimately blocks crucial functionalities of the contract, such as `claim` and `clawback`, hindering the intended operation of the incentive mechanism.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The primary mitigation for this issue is to remove the second call to `_initializeOwner` from the `initialize` function

```diff
function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public override initializer {
    _initializeOwner(msg.sender); // Call once to set owner
    InitPayload memory init_ = abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload));
    
    // Initialization logic...

-   _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
}

```
