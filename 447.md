# maxParticipants and protocolFee are unused in BoostCore contract

## Summary
The `maxParticipants` and `protocolFee` variables are declared but unused in the BoostCore contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Both `maxParticipants` and `protocolFee` are stored when creating a new boost. However, these variables are not utilized anywhere in the contract. Based on their names, `maxParticipants` should be used to limit the number of unique users claiming a specific boost, while `protocolFee` should be incorporated into the `_routeClaimFee()` function for fee calculations.

## Impact
This issue deviates from the expected logic outlined by the Boost Protocol team, which may hinder future developments. In particular, the omission of `protocolFee` could affect the protocol's revenue by leading to incorrect fee calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a mechanism to track the number of unique users and compare it with `maxParticipants`. Additionally, incorporate `protocolFee` in the fee calculation logic.
