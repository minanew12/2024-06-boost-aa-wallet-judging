# `BoostRegistry::register` does not implement authentication in which griefing attacks can not be prevented

### Summary

The absence of authentication in the `BoostRegistry::register` function exposes the system to potential griefing attacks. Malicious actors can easily register invalid or junk namespaces, which can hinder legitimate users from registering valid namespaces. While the sponsor has acknowledged this issue, **he stated that reactive authentication will be used**:
> We understand there may be griefing vectors related to registering junk namespaces on the registry, and spamming createBoost **but we'll deploy auth reactively to these issues when/if they manifest**.

However, the authentication is not used and there is no current mechanism to prevent such attacks proactively.

### Root Cause

The [BoostRegistry::register](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/d9f597776cc2d20fbb19ffb1f7731126cf3b6210/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostRegistry.sol#L83-L93) function does not implement an authentication mechanism, leaving it vulnerable to griefing attacks where malicious users can spam the registration of junk or invalid namespaces. Unlike `BoostCore::create`, which includes an authentication layer, the register function does not have any form of access control or verification.
```solidity
function register(RegistryType type_, string calldata name_, address implementation_) external onlyACloneables(implementation_) {
        
    bytes32 identifier = getIdentifier(type_, name_);

    if (address(_bases[identifier]) != address(0)) revert AlreadyRegistered(type_, identifier);
    _bases[identifier] = ACloneable(implementation_);

    emit Registered(type_, identifier, implementation_);
}
```
Griefing attacks can happen in different ways:
1. Malicious users can reserve a namespace with an invalid or junk implementation, preventing legitimate users from registering that identifier
2. Malicious actors can flood the registry with invalid or junk entries.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

- A malicious user can spam the registration of namespaces with invalid implementations.
- Legitimate users are unable to register their namespaces as the identifiers may already be reserved by junk implementations.
- Admins cannot mitigate or prevent these griefing attacks because no authentication mechanism is in place.

### Impact

Administrators cannot prevent or limit griefing attacks, leading to namespace pollution and potential disruption of legitimate operations within the BoostRegistry contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce an authentication layer to the `BoostRegistry::register` function, similar to the one implemented in `BoostCore::create`
```diff
+ modifier canRegister(address sender) {
+    if (address(registerAuth) != address(0) && !registerAuth.isAuthorized(sender)) {
+        revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
+   }
+    _;
+}

function register(RegistryType type_, string calldata name_, address implementation_) external onlyACloneables(implementation_) 
+    canRegister(msg.sender)
{
    // --SNIP
}
```
