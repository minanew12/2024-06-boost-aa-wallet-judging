# Edge Case Prevents Participants from Claiming Incentives When `ERC20VariableIncentive` and `ERC1155Incentive` Are Both Used

### Summary

An edge case exists where participants may be unable to claim their incentives if a boost includes both `ERC20VariableIncentive` and `ERC1155Incentive`. This occurs due to mismatched data being passed during the claim process, leading to transaction reverts.


### Root Cause

Participants claim their incentives by calling `BoostCore::claimIncentiveFor` after that validators signed all the incentives to claim from the boost, passing relevant claim data to be validated by the boost validator:
```solidity
function claimIncentiveFor(uint256 boostId_, uint256 incentiveId_, address referrer_, bytes calldata data_, address claimant) public payable nonReentrant {
    // --SNIP
>>>    if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
    if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
        revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
    }
}
```
The `claimData` passed to the validator is of type [BoostClaimData](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/shared/IBoostClaim.sol#L6-L9), which includes both `ValidatorData` and `IncentiveData`:
```solidity
function validate(uint256 boostId, uint256 incentiveId, address claimant, bytes calldata claimData) external override returns(bool) {
    if (msg.sender != _validatorCaller) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
>>>    (BoostClaimData memory claim) = abi.decode(claimData, (BoostClaimData));
}

// IBoostClaim
struct BoostClaimData {
    bytes validatorData;
    bytes incentiveData;
}
```
The `incentiveData` represents the amount of ERC20 tokens to claim from `ERC20VariableIncentive`, as seen in the claim function:
```solidity
// ERC20VariableIncentive

function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    BoostClaimData memory boostClaimData = abi.decode(data_, (BoostClaimData));
    uint256 signedAmount = abi.decode(boostClaimData.incentiveData, (uint256));
    // --SNIP
}
```
However, when `ERC1155Incentive` is also configured for the boost, the same `claimData` is passed (and should be for the validation to pass). This causes an issue with `ERC1155Incentive` if the `data_` parameter is used in the `transferFrom` function, as it expects different data:
```solidity
// ERC1155Incentive::claim
function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata data_) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    // Disburse the incentive based on the strategy (POOL only for now)
    if (strategy == Strategy.POOL) {
        if (!_isClaimable(claimTarget)) revert NotClaimable();

        claims++;
        claimed[claimTarget] = true;

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (not a risk here)
>>>        asset.safeTransferFrom(address(this), claimTarget, tokenId, 1, data_);
        emit Claimed(claimTarget, abi.encodePacked(asset, claimTarget, tokenId, uint256(1), data_));

        return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```
If the `data_` parameter passed is irrelevant to the `ERC1155Incentive`'s asset, the transaction will likely revert, preventing participants from successfully claiming their incentives.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Both `ERC20VariableIncentive` and `ERC1155Incentive` are configured for a boost.
- The target `ERC1155Incentive`'s asset relies on the `data_` parameter in the `transferFrom` function.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Not an attack, but a bug that prevents claiming incentives, check root cause section.


### Impact

Participants may be unable to claim their incentives due to irrelevant or incorrect `data_` being passed to the `ERC1155Incentive`. This can lead to transaction reverts and unclaimed incentives.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider including other data to be passed for `ERC1155Incentive`'s asset contract.
