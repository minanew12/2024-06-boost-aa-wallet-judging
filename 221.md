# Lack of Trust in ERC165 Interface Claim by Malicious Contracts


## Summary
The contract uses ERC165 to verify whether a base implementation supports the `ACloneable` interface. However, ERC165 allows contracts to claim support for an interface without correctly implementing it. A malicious contract could exploit this by falsely claiming to implement the interface, potentially leading to incorrect or insecure behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `BoostCore::_checkTarget` function relies on the `supportsInterface` method from ERC165 to verify whether a given contract (`instance`) supports the `ACloneable` interface. ERC165, while useful for interface detection, does not enforce the correctness of the implementation. A contract could return `true` for `supportsInterface(interfaceId)` but not actually comply with the interface's intended behavior. This creates a potential risk if malicious contracts are used as targets, which could result in incorrect behavior or unintended execution.

## Impact
A malicious contract could falsely claim to implement the required interface (ACloneable), leading to potential logic flaws, incorrect behavior, or security vulnerabilities in the system. This can undermine the trust of the protocol in external contracts and lead to unexpected outcomes or exploits.

## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not solely rely on ERC165 for interface compliance. Implement an additional verification mechanism to ensure the contract correctly implements the required interface. This can include calling specific methods from the interface or performing other logic checks beyond the `supportsInterface` function to verify the behavior of the target contra
