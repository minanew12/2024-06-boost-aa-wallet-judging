# Limited Functionality in AllowList Management: Inability to Add Multiple Addresses in _makeAllowListPayload()

### Summary

In the `_makeAllowListPayload()` function within `AllowListIncentive.sol`. The vulnerability arises due to a limitation in the array size, which restricts the function to adding only a single user at a time. This can lead to potential scalability issues or the inability to manage multiple users in the allow list, potentially hindering the contract's access control mechanisms.

### Root Cause

In AllowListIncentive.sol:74 [Here](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/boost-protocol/blob/315e6a83d1ba137d95d5904e8f5fd1b513d5c505/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/AllowListIncentive.sol#L74) the function initializes an `address[]` array with a fixed size of 1, which restricts the function to handle only a single address `(target_)`. This design flaw limits the contract's ability to manage multiple users, resulting in restricted functionality.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `_makeAllowListPayload()` function only initializes a fixed-size array, restricting the capacity to a single address.
2. No mechanism is in place to handle multiple users in the `allowlist`.

### External pre-conditions

The contract only accepts one address at a time, potentially limiting its ability to scale when multiple users need to be added simultaneously.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The inability to handle multiple addresses in the `_makeAllowListPayload()` function leads to inefficient access control and increased gas costs. Users must submit multiple transactions to add each address individually, resulting in higher operational costs and potential delays in managing large-scale user `allowlists`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `_makeAllowListPayload()` function to dynamically handle multiple addresses, improving scalability and access control.
