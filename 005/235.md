# Some incentives cannot be claimed due to logic implemented in `SignerValidator`

### Summary

Due to how validating logic is implemented in `SignerValidator`, some users can never claim certain incentives despite having valid signature.

### Root Cause

In [`SignerValidator::validate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L50), which acts as the entry point for incentive claiming, validates for valid signature, and prevents replay attacks, here is its logic:
```solidity
    function validate(uint256 boostId, uint256 incentiveId, address claimant, bytes calldata claimData)
        external
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        if (msg.sender != _validatorCaller) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        (BoostClaimData memory claim) = abi.decode(claimData, (BoostClaimData));
        (SignerValidatorInputParams memory validatorData) =
            abi.decode(claim.validatorData, (SignerValidatorInputParams));

        bytes32 hash = hashSignerData(boostId, validatorData.incentiveQuantity, claimant, claim.incentiveData);

        if (uint256(validatorData.incentiveQuantity) <= incentiveId) {
            revert BoostError.InvalidIncentive(validatorData.incentiveQuantity, incentiveId);
        }
        if (!signers[validatorData.signer]) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        // Mark the incentive as claimed to prevent replays
        // checks internally if the incentive has already been claimed
        _used.setOrThrow(hash, incentiveId);

        // Return the result of the signature check
        // no need for a sig prefix since it's encoded by the EIP712 lib
        return validatorData.signer.isValidSignatureNow(hash, validatorData.signature);
    }
```

This requires `incentiveQuantity > incentiveId`, and users can claim multiple incentives with the same signature, this is as per design. But this also brings an issue, for example, when there are total 6 incentives, and user is granted `incentiveQuantity` of 2, he can only claim incentives from id 0, 1, and 2. So when the user wants to claim incentive with id 4, he will be denied due to this logic.

### PoC

1. Boost is created to have 6 incentives, their ids ranging from 0 to 5
2. Bob is granted a signature with `incentiveQuantity` being 2, meaning he can only claim incentives with id 0 and 1.
3. Any incentives with id beyond this will not be claimed, as their id is greater than the quantity, despite Bob may have claimed nothing, and still eligible for claiming two more incentives.

### Mitigation

Compare `incentiveQuantity` with the total amount of times which user has claimed in the boost or for the hash.
