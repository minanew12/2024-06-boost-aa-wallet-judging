# `incentiveId_` is not included in the hash that is signed by the validator will allow anyone to claim for a user

### Summary

`incentiveId_` is not included in the hash that is signed by the validator will allow anyone to claim for a user.

### Root Cause

`incentiveId_` is not included in the hash that is signed by the validator

```solidity
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
>>      uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, function is nonReentrant)
>>      if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }

```solidity
    function validate(uint256 boostId, uint256 incentiveId, address claimant, bytes calldata claimData)
        external
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        if (msg.sender != _validatorCaller) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        (BoostClaimData memory claim) = abi.decode(claimData, (BoostClaimData));
        (SignerValidatorInputParams memory validatorData) =
            abi.decode(claim.validatorData, (SignerValidatorInputParams));

>>      bytes32 hash = hashSignerData(boostId, validatorData.incentiveQuantity, claimant, claim.incentiveData);

        if (uint256(validatorData.incentiveQuantity) <= incentiveId) {
            revert BoostError.InvalidIncentive(validatorData.incentiveQuantity, incentiveId);
        }
        if (!signers[validatorData.signer]) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        // Mark the incentive as claimed to prevent replays
        // checks internally if the incentive has already been claimed
        _used.setOrThrow(hash, incentiveId);

        // Return the result of the signature check
        // no need for a sig prefix since it's encoded by the EIP712 lib
        return validatorData.signer.isValidSignatureNow(hash, validatorData.signature);
    }

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls to `claimIncentive` with 
   - `boostId_ = 0`
   - `incentiveId_ = 2`
   - `referrer_ = address(0)`
   - `data_ = 0xdeadbeef`
   - `validatorData.incentiveQuantity = 3`
2. The attacker uses the same `data_` to call to `claimIncentiveFor` with:
   - `boostId_ = 0`
   - `incentiveId_ = 1`
   - `referrer_ = address(0)`
   - `data_ = 0xdeadbeef`
   - `validatorData.incentiveQuantity = 3`
   - `claimant = address(Alice)`

Since the hash that is validated in `SignerValidator#validate` does not include `incentiveId_`, the attacker's transaction will pass this validation

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L61

Moreover, by specifying `incentiveId_ = 1`, the check of `incentiveId` against `validatorData.incentiveQuantity` is also passed

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L63C21-L63C52

As a result, the attacker successfully claim the incentive with `id = 1` for the user. Whereas the user intention is only claiming the incentive with `id = 2`.

### Impact

Although the incentive that is claimed by the attacker will be transferred to the user. Note that, the attacker does not steal the incentive of the user. But the attacker claims the incentive that is not expected to be claimed by the user.

This behavior will cause problem in the `CGDAIncentive` contract. For this type of incentive, the longer the user waits the more incentive the user can claim. By launching this attack, the attacker forces the user to claim early in this type of incentive, and the user can not claim again in the future. In this case, the user will lose out on the incentive, because the attacker claims early for the user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include `incentiveId_` in the hash that is signed by the validator.
