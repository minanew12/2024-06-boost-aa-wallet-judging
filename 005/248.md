# Signer Can DoS Boost He Is Not Authorized For.

## Summary
The SignerValidator.validate() function contains a significant vulnerability where incentives are marked as claimed prior to signature verification. Due to the utilization of IncentiveBits for replay prevention, incentives that are blocked cannot be reclaimed, potentially resulting in a long-term Denial of Service (DoS) issue.
[GitHub](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L115)

## Vulnerability Detail
1. The `validate` function in `SignerValidator.sol` verifies if a signer has general authorization but fails to confirm their specific authorization for the Boost being claimed.
2. The function sets an incentive as claimed using `_used.setOrThrow(hash, incentiveId)` before validating the signature.
3. This vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious signer through:
   - Generating an invalid signature for a claim on any Boost.
   - Invoking `claimIncentiveFor` on BoostCore for that particular Boost.
   - The `validate` function will mark the incentive as claimed before failing the signature verification.
4. Once an incentive is flagged as claimed, it becomes impossible to claim again due to the replay protection mechanism implemented by the `IncentiveBits` library.

## Impact
A single compromised signer has the potential to prevent incentive claims across all Boosts within the system.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function validate(uint256 boostId, uint256 incentiveId, address claimant, bytes calldata claimData)
    external
    override
    returns (bool)
 {
    // ... (other code)
    if (!signers[validatorData.signer]) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
    // Mark the incentive as claimed before verifying the signature
    _used.setOrThrow(hash, incentiveId);
    // Verify signature after marking as claimed
    return validatorData.signer.isValidSignatureNow(hash, validatorData.signature);
 }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restructure the validate function to verify Boost-specific authorization and validate the signature before marking the incentive as claimed:

```solidity

function validate(uint256 boostId, uint256 incentiveId, address claimant, bytes calldata claimData)
       external
       override
       returns (bool)
   {
       // ... (other code)
       if (!boostSigners[validatorData.signer]) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
       // Verify the signature before marking the incentive as claimed
       if (!validatorData.signer.isValidSignatureNow(hash, validatorData.signature)) {
           return false;
       }
       // Mark the incentive as claimed only after successful signature verification
       _used.setOrThrow(hash, incentiveId);
       return true;
   }
```
