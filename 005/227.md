# `referrer_` is not included in the hash that is signed by the validator will cause loss of `referralShare` as an attacker will redirect `referralShare` to a different address

### Summary

`referrer_` is not included in the hash that is signed by the validator will cause loss of `referralShare` as an attacker will redirect `referralShare` to a different address.

### Root Cause

`referrer_` is not included in the hash that is signed by the validator

```solidity
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
>>      address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, function is nonReentrant)
>>      if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls to `claimIncentive` with 
   - `boostId_ = 0`
   - `incentiveId_ = 0`
   - `referrer_ = address(0x1234)`
   - `data_ = 0xdeadbeef`
2. The attacker front-run Alice's transaction by calling `claimIncentiveFor` with:
   - `boostId_ = 0`
   - `incentiveId_ = 0`
   - `referrer_ = address(0x5678)`
   - `data_ = 0xdeadbeef`
   - `claimant = address(Alice)`

Since the hash that is validated in `SignerValidator#validate` does not include `referrer_`, the attacker's transaction will pass this validation

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/78930f2ed6570f30e356b5529bd4bcbe5194eb8b/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/validators/SignerValidator.sol#L61

And the attacker will successfully transfer the `referralShare` to the address `0x5678` instead of the address `0x1234`.

### Impact

- The user can not give the `referralShare` to the address that they want

Although the attacker has to pay for all the `claimFee`, they can get back a proportion of the `claimFee` by setting `referrer_` to their address. The attacker still loses more than they gain. This attack is a griefing attack.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include `referrer_` in the hash that is signed by the validator.
