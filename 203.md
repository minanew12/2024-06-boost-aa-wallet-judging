# Immediate Claims Lead to Zero Rewards Due to Time Decay Exploit in Reward Calculation Logic

### Summary

In the `claim()` and `currentReward()` functions. The vulnerability arises because the `currentReward()` function may return a reward value of zero when `timeSinceLastClaim` is zero, effectively "killing" the projected reward. This is due to a combination of inadequate reward calculation and improper handling of reward decay, leading to failed or minimal rewards during claims.



### Root Cause

In `CGDAIncentive.sol:85`  in `claim()`  ` cgdaParams.lastClaimTime = block.timestamp;`
  [Here](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/boost-protocol/blob/315e6a83d1ba137d95d5904e8f5fd1b513d5c505/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L91) 
then in `currentReward()` `uint256 timeSinceLastClaim = block.timestamp - cgdaParams.lastClaimTime;`  [Here](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/boost-protocol/blob/315e6a83d1ba137d95d5904e8f5fd1b513d5c505/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L124) means the `timeSinceLastClaim` will be **zero**
with `timeSinceLastClaim` (Zero value) its going to multiple at [Here](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/boost-protocol/blob/315e6a83d1ba137d95d5904e8f5fd1b513d5c505/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/CGDAIncentive.sol#L129) hence the `projectedReward` will be **zero** .

### Attack Path

An attacker or any user can trigger the claim function when `timeSinceLastClaim` is zero, leading to minimal or zero rewards being transferred, even if funds are available in the contract. This makes the reward system ineffective.

### Impact

Users experience failed or minimal reward payouts when the claim is triggered in quick succession, as 'timeSinceLastClaim' will be zero. The improper balance validation and reward decay logic further reduce the reward, leading to a failure in the intended incentive mechanism.
