# User signature can be used to claim incentive without his permission leading to loss of funds for a user

### Summary

`claimIncentiveFor` function does not ensure that the `msg.sender` has permission to claim the incetives for the user. It allows attacker to use this signature to claim incentive for a user in a moment that benefits the attacker or does not benefit the user at all.

### Root Cause

Lack of permission validation in `claimIncentiveFor` function inside `BoostCore`.

We can see that `validate` function in `SignerValidator` only validates that the msg.sender is whitelisted address.

```javascript
function validate(
        uint256 boostId,
        uint256 incentiveId,
        address claimant,
        bytes calldata claimData
    ) external override returns (bool) {
        if (msg.sender != _validatorCaller) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        BoostClaimData memory claim = abi.decode(claimData, (BoostClaimData));
        SignerValidatorInputParams memory validatorData = abi.decode(
            claim.validatorData,
            (SignerValidatorInputParams)
        );

        bytes32 hash = hashSignerData(
            boostId,
            validatorData.incentiveQuantity,
            claimant,
            claim.incentiveData
        );

        if (uint256(validatorData.incentiveQuantity) <= incentiveId) {
            revert BoostError.InvalidIncentive(
                validatorData.incentiveQuantity,
                incentiveId
            );
        }
        if (!signers[validatorData.signer]) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();

        // Mark the incentive as claimed to prevent replays
        // checks internally if the incentive has already been claimed
        _used.setOrThrow(hash, incentiveId);

        // Return the result of the signature check
        // no need for a sig prefix since it's encoded by the EIP712 lib
        return
            validatorData.signer.isValidSignatureNow(
                hash,
                validatorData.signature
            );
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User has valid signature created by backend validator
2. Attacker saw users signature. User could have created the transation and cancel it when the transaction was still in mempool.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User executes action
2. Backend validator validates action off-chain
3. Backend validator creates signature for the user
4. User creates transaction to claim the incentive
5. User changes his mind and decides to cancel the transaction
6. Attacker sees the signature and calls `claimIncentiveFor` with user's signature

### Impact

User can lose big part of his incentive when attacker claims it in the right moment.

In CGDAIncentive contract:

An attacker could grief user and claim incentive when the reward is very small. For example in `CGDAIncentive` user wishes to try to claim the tokens when the reward is `100`. Attacker calls `claimIncentiveFor` when the current reward is equal to `5`. As a result the user receives 5 tokens and can no longer take part in an acution.

Current implementation violates EIP712 security considerations:

"The mechanism for reliably broadcasting a signature is application-specific and out of scope for this standard. When the signature is broadcast to a blockchain for use in a contract, the application has to be secure against frontrunning attacks. In this kind of attack, an attacker intercepts the signature and submits it to the contract before the original intended use takes place. The application should behave correctly when the signature is submitted first by an attacker, for example by rejecting it or simply producing exactly the same effect as intended by the signer."

In this scenario when attacker submits the signature, different amount of tokens is received by the user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Create new mechanism in which the user can whitelist addresses that can claim incentives on user's behalf.
