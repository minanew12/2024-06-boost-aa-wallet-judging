# Claimants Can Be Gas Griefed For PointsIncentive

## Summary

This issue will NOT fall under ->

`Boost creators are trusted to not prevent incentives claims.`

The following issue talks about how users when claiming the incentive can be gas griefed .

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) The user performs an action for a boost whose incentive was PointIncentive.sol

2.) Inside PointIncentive's claim we have ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/incentives/PointsIncentive.sol#L60

this makes a call to the `venue` address , and a function is called on the venue (which is the `selector` ). 

3.) This function in the venue contract can be configured to consume all of the gas in the call (according to 63/64 rule just enough gas  should be remaining to complete the call successfully) and since all of the gas id forwarded in the call , all of the gas would be consumed(plus , anyone can deploy incentives using registry).

4.) Therefore when our user claims the incentive in the BoostCore which calls the above claim function in the PointsIncentive , 
the honest user would loose funds in the form of gas .

 
## Impact

The user might loose more funds due to gas griefing than what he actually would gain from the incentive claim.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The entire gas should not be forwarded , it should be just enough so that the function in the venue contract executes successfully.
