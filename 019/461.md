# Missing max participants check

## Summary

In the BoostCore contract, when creating a boost, a maxParticipants parameter is passed, which is supposed to define the maximum number of participants for a given boost. The problem is that this parameter is only set but never used, leaving users with the impression that there is a limit on the number of participants when, in fact, there is no such limit. This could lead to a loss of funds for the participants who first met the participation requirements, due to the addition of more participants than initially planned.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the tests included in the codebase, the setting of this parameter is tested in various ways, leading to the conclusion that functionality was planned but, for some reason, was not implemented.

```solidity
    // Initialize the Boost
    BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts.push();
    boost.owner = payload_.owner;
    boost.budget = payload_.budget;
    boost.protocolFee = protocolFee + payload_.protocolFee;
    boost.referralFee = referralFee + payload_.referralFee;
@>  boost.maxParticipants = payload_.maxParticipants;
```

## Impact

Missing important check which may lead to lose of funds for the early participants because of too many participants.

## Recommendation

Implement maxParticipants check in the function claimIncentiveFor().
