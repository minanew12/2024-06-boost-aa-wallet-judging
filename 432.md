# No way to recover funds if the Boost owner address is compromised which leads to user [incentive/funds] getting compromised.

## Summary
When someone setup the Boost for their protocol marketing or any purpose the `msg.sender` will be setted as an owner but there's no way to change the owner or pause the activity of the Boost if some mishap happens like getting the owner address compromised and loosing out all the funds from the user incentives.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the Boost is running live and users are completing the tasks to earn the incentive but suddenly somehow the Boost Creator address [Particular Boost Owner] address gets compromised and the protocol which is running the boost wants to pause or stop the Boost which they are running there will be no way they can stop or they can ask to stop to the Boost Protocol.
The compromised address is the owner so he can prevent users from claiming the incentives and he can drain all the Boost funds which is allocated . This can leads to huge fund loss for the protocol running boost and the users who spend their funds or completing tasks For eg:- Staking or Providing liquidity in return they will be expecting rewards but instead or rewards they will receive nothing.

## Impact
User and Protocol funds can be drained if the Boost Creator[Particular Boost owner] address is compromised.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation
Try adding functionality to pause the Boost or stop the fund [Incentive claim] for that particular boost.
Adding a function which can change the owner [can only be called by the Owner of the Boost Protocol] will help in this kind of scenario.
