# Malicious Actor Could DoS Legitimate Users to Claim Their Rewards

## Summary
The `ERC721MintAction` contract is vulnerable to a front-running attack. A malicious user can observe a legitimate user's transaction, replicate the token ID and user address, and submit a fraudulent transaction. This would mark the `validated[tokenId] = true`, preventing the legitimate user from claiming their rewards when they call `BoostCore#claimIncentiveFor` or `BoostCore#claimIncentive`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The core issue arises from the design of the validation process within the `validate` function. Specifically, the logic does not ensure that the caller of the transaction is someone who could have the rights to call this function, rather than the function is callable by anyone which open the path for this attack. The function checks the ownership of the token using the provided `holder` address and the `tokenId`, but fails to account for front-running attacks where a malicious actor can monitor the transaction mempool and submit a transaction using the legitimate user's address and token ID.

```solidity 
    function validate(uint256, /*unused*/ uint256, /* unused */ address, /*unused*/ bytes calldata data_)
        external
        virtual
        override
        returns (bool success)
    {
        (address holder, bytes memory payload) = abi.decode(data_, (address, bytes));
        uint256 tokenId = uint256(bytes32(payload));

        if (ERC721(target).ownerOf(tokenId) == holder && !validated[tokenId]) {
            validated[tokenId] = true;
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
```

### Vulnerability Flow:
1. Legitimate Transaction: A legitimate user initiates an action, expecting to claim a reward.
2. Malicious Observation: A malicious user observes the transaction in the mempool and sees the user's address and token ID.
3. Malicious Front-Running: The malicious user submits a transaction with the same `holder` address and `tokenId` as the legitimate user. This transaction marks `validated[tokenId] = true`.
4. Legitimate User's Transaction Fails: When the legitimate user tries to claim the reward, the check `if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();` in the `BoostCore` contract fails, as the token ID has already been marked as validated by the malicious user's transaction. This results in the legitimate user's inability to claim their reward.

```solidity 
    function claimIncentiveFor(
        uint256 boostId_,
        uint256 incentiveId_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        address claimant
    ) public payable nonReentrant {
        BoostLib.Boost storage boost = _boosts[boostId_];
        if (msg.value < claimFee) revert BoostError.InsufficientFunds(address(0), msg.value, claimFee);
        _routeClaimFee(boost, referrer_);

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy (false positive, function is nonReentrant)
ðŸ‘‰      if (!boost.validator.validate(boostId_, incentiveId_, claimant, data_)) revert BoostError.Unauthorized();
        if (!boost.incentives[incentiveId_].claim(claimant, data_)) {
            revert BoostError.ClaimFailed(claimant, data_);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
The legitimate user is unable to claim their rewards because the token ID  has already been marked as validated by the malicious user's front-running transaction.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-boost-aa-wallet/blob/main/boost-protocol/packages/evm/contracts/actions/ERC721MintAction.sol#L54-L66

This code allows a malicious user to mark a `tokenId` as validated by submitting a transaction with the legitimate user's address and token ID.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `validate` function to be callable only by authorized addresses.
